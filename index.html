<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://bookdownloadpagehere.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>The Little Fire Engine (The Little Train)</h2><p><b>The classic underdog story of one brave little fire engine and his drive, by Graham Greene and Edward Ardizzone</b><br> <br> One day a shiny new fire engine arrives in Little Snoreing and Sam Trolley and the old-fashioned little fire engine are told they're not needed anymore. But one evening a fire breaks out and all the new firemen are busy. Will the little fire engine be able to save the day?</p><p><b>Graham Greene </b>(1904-1991) was a novelist and author regarded as one of the greatest writers of the 20th century. He more more than 25 novels, and four children's books.&nbsp; <b>Edward Ardizzone </b>(1900-1979) was an artist and children's book creator. He illustrated a large number of books, including Graham Greene&#x2019;s<i> </i>The Little Train series, and wrote and illustrated many more including the well-loved Little Tim series, and with his cousin Christianna Brand, created Nurse Matilda, later familiar to many as Nanny McPhee.</p><h2>Analytical Solutions for Extremal Space Trajectories</h2><p><p><i>Analytical Solutions for Extremal Space Trajectories</i> presents an overall treatment of the general optimal control problem, in particular, the Mayer&#x2019;s variational problem, with necessary and sufficient conditions of optimality. It also provides a detailed derivation of the analytical solutions of these problems for thrust arcs for the Newtonian, linear central and uniform gravitational fields. These solutions are then used to analytically synthesize the extremal and optimal trajectories for the design of various orbital transfer and powered descent and landing maneuvers. Many numerical examples utilizing the proposed analytical synthesis of the space trajectories and comparison analyses with numerically integrated solutions are provided.</p> <p>This book will be helpful for engineers and researchers of industrial and government organizations, and is also a great resource for university faculty and graduate and undergraduate students working, specializing or majoring in the fields of aerospace engineering, applied celestial mechanics, and guidance, navigation and control technologies, applied mathematics and analytical dynamics, and avionics software design and development.</p><ul><li>Features an analyses of Pontryagin extremals and/or Pontryagin minimum in the context of space trajectory design</li><li>Presents the general methodology of an analytical synthesis of the extremal and optimal trajectories for the design of various orbital transfer and powered descent and landing maneuvers</li><li>Assists in developing the optimal control theory for applications in aerospace technology and space mission design</li></ul></p><p>Dilmurat Azimov has nearly 25 years of experience in the areas of space trajectory optimization, guidance, navigation and control of flight vehicles, and orbit determination using observations. His expertise includes derivation of the analytical solutions for optimal control problems, and their application in mission design and development and implementation of guidance, control and targeting schemes.</p><h2>Cinema Anime: Critical Engagements with Japanese Animation</h2><p>This collection charts the terrain of contemporary Japanese animation, one of the most explosive forms of visual culture to emerge at the crossroads of transnational cultural production in the last twenty-five years. The essays offer bold and insightful</p><p>STEVEN T. BROWN is Associate Professor of Japanese Literature and Popular Culture at the University of Oregon, USA.<p>"Both cinema and animation have served simultaneously as transnational cultural forms as well as national forums, formed by specific discourses on nationalism and modernization. In fact, in the 1910s-20s Japan, animation was not defined as distinct from cinema in terms of social regulations or production concerns. Animation, together with cinema, came under the scrutiny of public educators, censors and national ideologues. The point of intersection for these diverse concerns was the construction of national cinema for international dissemination. The attempt of Cinema Anime to dismantle the distinction between cinema and animation, national cinema and transnational visual culture, is genuinely challenging, but definitely necessary in the tension-ridden period of media globalization."</p> <p>-Daisuke Miyao, University of Oregon, USA</p> <p>'Cinema Anime is an important and thought-provoking collection of essays by a number of the leading figures in the field. It includes some of the first scholarly work on several challenging and noteworthy anime that have not received enough academic attention up to now. With chapters that range from cross-cultural overviews to ambitious critical interventions, this volume will be of interest to a wide audience, from students to experienced scholars. Indeed, Cinema Anime should be required reading for anyone committed to anime criticism.'</p> <p>-Christopher Bolton, Senior Editorial Board, Mechademia</p> <p>"The brain is the screen," as quoted in the introduction, is an apt expression of Cinema Anime's aim to keep thinking in new ways about anime even as it gains its mindshare, to take new positions towards it even as it finds its place. Its academics know where to look within LAIN, the one show that best learned the liberating message of EVANGELION; Satoshi Kon, the most important anime director to emerge in the past decade and without, showing how film technology itself informs the narrative of anime and how contemporary installation artists draw it forth from flatland to examine our real space. Cinema Anime rephrases the question: where anime is, rather than what it is to be defined.</p> <p>-Carl Gustav Horn, author of Strange Colors: The Power of Japanese Animation</p> <p>'This is a worthy addition to any Anime fans' library or for those who want to study the media in more depth.' - Phil Jones, SF Crowsnest</p></p><h2>Seven Theories of Human Society</h2><p>The social sciences cover a wide field, and in this introductory book Tom Campbell presents seven contrasting theories of significance for sociology, politics, economics, law, psychology, and history. His concern is to clarify the logical structure, methodological assumptions, and practical<br>implications of the different theories, with the aim of encouraging informed and critical study of social thought.<br>He begins in Part I with a discussion of the nature of social and political theory and an outline of the ways in which different theories may be compared and assessed. In Part II he examines and contrasts seven major theories. Although he presents the theories in terms of individual thinkers,<br>each theorist provides a vehicle for the study of a particular important type of theory. Against the historical perspective of Aristotle's theory of man, Hobbes's egoistic theory, and Adam Smith's idea of the social system, Professor Campbell sets the modern giants: Marx and conflict theory,<br>Durkheim and consensus theory, and Weber's theory of social action. Finally, Alfred Schutz serves as a bridge to such recent developments as ethnomethodology. The chronological order of presentation illustrates the development of social theory and the way in which it is affected by social change.<br>The book concludes in Part III with a consideration of some of the philosophical issues which underlie the main differences between the seven types of social theory. The combination of information and analysis, and the selection of theorists of significance for a wide range of social sciences,<br>make this book an invaluable introduction to the study of human society and historically important types of social theory.</p><p>Tom Campbell is Professor of Jurisprudence at the University of Glasgow, and was formerly Professor of Philosophy at the University of Stirling.`'...His critiques of the various theories are judicious and occasonally insightful. This book is an excellent place for any student to begin an investigation of any of the figures discussed in this study on the nature of religion.''<br>Carl Olson, World Faiths Encounter</p><h2>Moore&#39;s Historical Guide To The Battle Of Bentonville</h2><p>In this large-format guide to the field where Sherman and Johnston fought their final battle, detailed route and battle maps are keyed to highway historical markers and accompanied by battle descriptions.</p><p>Now in its third printing . . . <p>Some of the best maps available today in Civil War History.</p>As Sherman pushed into North Carolina with an army of 60,000 veterans in the spring of 1865, Confederate general Joseph E. Johnston forged a bold plan to stop the Union juggernaut. Johnston, rarely the aggressor, assembled a motley conglomerate of garrison troops and hardened veterans at the eleventh hour. It was perhaps the most decisive action undertaken by &#34;Old Joe&#34; during the war, and it resulted in a final bloody encounter with the enemy in the pine barrens of the Old North State . . .</p><h2>Frogs, Flies, and Dandelions: Speciation--The Evolution of New Species</h2><p>The earth is home to a wild proliferation of species, millions of life-forms that come in a spectacular--and often bizarre--array of sizes, shapes, and colors. But what triggers this fantastic explosion of life? How does one species split into another? Even Charles Darwin was baffled before such questions, calling them "The Mystery of Mysteries." <br> In this fascinating, witty, and vividly written book, Menno Schilthuizen illuminates these questions, showing how biologists and zoologists over the last two centuries have responded to them, assessing our current knowledge of species, and proposing his own solution to Darwin's mystery. Using the sometimes-vicious academic debates and the powerful personalities of scientists as background, Schilthuizen explores the meandering path of species research and sets it out in the clearest possible terms. From looking at how we define a species, to exploring how geographical isolation and sexual selection contribute to making new species, to showing how species may appear gradually or instantaneously, <em>Frogs, Flies, and Dandelions</em> offers a comprehensive account of this evolutionary drama. Along the way, we get to know a remarkable cast of characters from the plant and animal kingdoms, from the copper-loving monkey flower to sockeye salmon, fire-bellied toads, lyrebirds, apple maggot flies, and many others. Most important, we get a clear picture of all the conditions necessary for one species to give birth to another. <br> Written with engaging panache, and illuminating an area of study intensely relevant to any assessment of the earth's biodiversity, <em>Frogs, Flies, and Dandelions</em> will appeal to everyone--scientist and layperson alike--curious about nature and animal behavior.</p><p><br><strong>Menno Schilthuizen</strong> is Associate Professor in the Tropical Biology and Conservation Unit, at the University Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabulu, Malaysia.<br>Perhaps the most long-standing question in evolutionary biology concerns the origin of species. What are the environmental, evolutionary, genetic, geographical, behavioral or physiological conditions necessary for a species to split into two? Schilthuizen, professor of biology at the University of Malaysia Sabah in Malaysia, does a superb job of reviewing the voluminous scientific literature on this topic, distilling it to a manageable size and presenting it in a form that is both engaging and accessible for the nonspecialist. In addition to a good deal of natural history, from descriptions of the mating behaviors of fire-bellied toads to the differences between left- and right-handled snails, Schilthuizen provides an insider's perspective on both laboratory and field experiments. He analyzes in detail the controversy over whether populations must be geographically isolated from one another for new species to be formed, and he describes, with many interesting examples, the role that sexual selectionfemales choosing specific males with whom to matemight play in the speciation process. By including case studies from a wide range of organismsplants, birds, amphibians, fish and mammalshe demonstrates the breadth and vibrancy of his ideas. Although no technical background is required to grasp Schilthuizen's ideas, there is enough substance to engage those moderately knowledgeable about evolutionary biology.

Hulse lived and worked most of his life at the bottom of Canyon Creek in the Gila River country of southwestern New Mexico, but his reputation spread far and wide. His western image appeared on a tourist postcard and souvenir license plate in the 1950s. Footage of a lion hunt led by Hulse and his hounds appeared on the Men's Channel in 2005, three years after his passing.</p><p>Hulse grew up primarily in western New Mexico when that ranch and mining country was still remote and raw. At the age of ten he witnessed a point-blank shooting, the culmination of an old-fashioned frontier feud. He followed his parents between mines and towns until his father established a ranch at Canyon Creek. While serving in the navy during World War II, he landed on the bloody beach at Okinawa. After returning from the war, he was shot in a bar near Silver City during a night of carousing.</p><p>Hulse was most at home in the rugged Gila Wilderness, in which he ranched and guided for fifty years. With compassion and nuance, Nancy Coggeshall tells the compelling biography of a unique western rancher constantly adjusting to the inroads of modernity into his traditional way of life. Drawing on oral history, archival sources, and her personal association with Hulse and the Gila, she brings this unique westerner, and New Mexican, to life.</p></p><p>The compelling biography of a unique western rancher constantly adjusting to the inroads of modernity into his traditional way of life.Nancy Coggeshall moved from Rhode Island to New Mexico, after living in London, England; Toronto, Ontario; and the Eastern Townships of Quebec. She quickly found herself at home among the ranching families and slower paced small-town life of the Land of Enchantment. She resides in Reserve, New Mexico.</p><h2>Ethics in the Public Domain: Essays in the Morality of Law and Politics</h2><p>In the past twenty years Joseph Raz has consolidated his reputation as one of the most acute, inventive, and energetic scholars currently at work in analytic moral and political theory. This new collection of essays forms a representative selection of his most significant contributions to a number of important debates, including the extent of political duty and obligation, and the issue of self-determination. He also examines aspects of the common (and ancient) theme of the relations between law and morality. This volume of essays, available in one volume for the first time, will be essential to legal philosophers and political theorists.<br></p><p>This important collection of essays opens with a pivotal essay on the implications of the moral duties which arise out of concern for the well-being of others. The first part of the book concentrates on the consequences of two central aspects of well-being: the importance on membership in groups--the role of belonging--and the active character of well-being--that it largely consists in successful activities.Joseph Raz is at Balliol College, Oxford.</p><h2>Varney&#39;s Pocket Midwife: A Companion to the Authoritative Text, Varney&#39;s Midwifery, Third Edition</h2><p>This portable handbook provides thorough coverage of all the essential clinical content for the practice of midwifery.</p><p></p><h2>Construction Management Fundamentals</h2><p><p>Construction management is about controlling time, cost, quality, and safety, and acting in a socially, politically, and environmentally acceptable manner. Undergraduate non-construction majors and graduate Construction Management students need a general, yet comprehensive, text that covers the fundamentals of construction so that they may operate within the aforementioned parameters. </p><p>The first edition of <i>Construction Management Fundamentals</i> gives students a solid understanding of construction so that, as designers and constructors, they will be better prepared to make intelligent design decisions and to interact in a meaningful and productive manner. For those students who may take only one or two construction courses, the material is covered in a logical, simple, and concise format.</p></p><p>Cliff Schexnayder (Tempe, AZ) Professor Del Webb School of Construction, Arizona State University.</p><h2>Kali&#39;s Child: The Mystical and the Erotic in the Life and Teachings of Ramakrishna</h2><p>The nineteenth-century Bengali mystic Ramakrishna played a major role in the development of Hinduism and is regarded as a modern saint. Yet he remains an enigma to followers unable to reconcile his saintly status with his eroticized language and actions.<br><br>In this work, Jeffrey J. Kripal attempts to untangle the paradox. He demonstrates that Ramakrishna's famous mystical experiences were driven by erotic energies that he neither fully accepted nor understood; the key to understanding this extraordinary figure, Kripal argues, lies in Tantra and its ritual, symbolic, and doctrinal equation of the mystical and the erotic.<br><br>Moving through Ramakrishna's world both chronologically and conceptually, <i>Kali's Child</i> employs two complementary interpretive strategies, a nuanced phenomenological reinterpretation of original Bengali texts and a nonreductive psychoanalytic reading of Ramakrishna's mystical eroticism. Kripal shows how the heterosexual structure of Tantric symbolism, the abusive way its rituals were often forced upon the saint, and Ramakrishna's own homosexual desires all came together to produce in him profound feelings of shame, disgust, and fear. Kripal establishes that the homosexuality of this great, if unwilling, Tantric mystic is linked inextricably to virtually every aspect of his life and teachings.</p><p></p><h2>How to Treat People: A Nurse&#39;s Notes</h2><p><p><strong>A fascinating and poignant memoir of the body and its care, told through the experiences of a young nurse.</strong></p><p>As a teenager, Molly Case underwent an operation that saved her life. Nearly a decade later, she finds herself in the operating room again&#x2015;this time as a trainee nurse. She learns to care for her patients, sharing not only their pain, but also life-affirming moments of hope. In doing so, she offers a compelling account of the processes that keep them alive, from respiratory examinations to surgical prep, and of the extraordinary moments of human connection that sustain both nurse and patient.</p><p>In rich, lyrical prose, Case illustrates the intricacies of the human condition through the hand of a stranger offered in solace, a gentle word in response to fear and anger, or the witnessing of a person&#x2019;s last breaths. It is these moments of empathy, in the extremis of human experience, that define us as people. But when Molly&#x2019;s father is admitted to the cardiac unit where she works, the professional and the personal suddenly collide.</p><p>Weaving together medical history, art, memoir, and science, <em>How to Treat People</em> beautifully explores the oscillating rhythms of life and death in a tender reminder that we can all find meaning in being, even for a moment, part of the lives of others.</p></p><p><strong>Molly Case</strong> is a spoken-word artist, writer, and nurse. She was born and raised in London, where she currently works at St George&#x2019;s Hospital as a cardiac nurse specialist. Her debut collection of poetry, <em>Underneath the Roses Where I Remembered Everything</em>, was published in 2015. She has appeared in the <em>Guardian</em>, the <em>Independent</em>, the <em>Times</em>, <em>Elle</em> magazine, and <em>Huffington Post</em>, and was named in the Health Service Journal&#x2019;s Inspirational Women list and the BBC&#x2019;s 100 Women list.&#x201c;Molly Case takes us on a wondrous journey into healthcare&#x2019;s mysterious world, interweaving her nursing care with science and history while, most importantly, offering her patients compassion, all in the midst of allowing us to peer into her personal life as she manages health issues striking her and her father. No one lives a life absent of illness or injury. I hope that when takotsubo syndrome (failing heart) overcomes me, Molly will be available to provide my care.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Henry Jay Przybylo, author of <em>Counting Backwards: A Doctor&#x2019;s Notes on Anesthesia</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Case has produced a serious book, one that deserves a place in the rich contemporary canon of medical memoirs...She is best when describing the conditions that mysteriously hover between physical and psychological...She shows us that the unique role of a nurse is to understand and care for people both physically and emotionally.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Guardian</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;This beguiling memoir traces Case&#x2019;s career as a nurse in various hospitals, and is by turns gut-wrenching in its visceral descriptions of medical emergencies, and filled with the joy and satisfaction of seeing a patient recover...Case&#x2019;s empathy and compassion are everywhere evident in this beautifully written narrative.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Sunday Times</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>How to Treat People</em> gets to the heart of who we are&#x2015;how we live and also how we die.

Spanning film, literature, and the entire expanse of American popular culture, from D. W. Griffith to hillbilly music to the Internet, Harkins illustrates how the image of the hillbilly has consistently served as both a marker of social derision and regional pride. He traces the corresponding changes in representations of the hillbilly from late-nineteenth century America, through the great Depression, the mass migrations of Southern Appalachians in the 1940s and 1950s, the War on Poverty in the mid 1960s, and to the present day. Harkins also argues that images of hillbillies have played a critical role in the construction of whiteness and modernity in twentieth century America. Richly illustrated with dozens of photographs, drawings, and film and television stills, this unique book stands as a testament to the enduring place of the hillbilly in the American imagination.</p><p><br><strong>Anthony Harkins</strong> is an Assistant Professor in History at Western Kentucky University.<br><br>"Anthony Harkins has written a fine book about how misconceptions were perpetuatedhe gives us insight into the ways the hillbilly icon has served the 'mainstream' belief system and the reasons the hillbilly icon had and has such power."--<em>Herb E. Smith, Journal of Appalachian Studies</em><p></p><br>"a sophisticated m�lange of image and reality regarding southern white culture"--<em> History of Education Quarterly</em><p></p><br>"Harkin's research is truly impressive, and his writing could not be clearer....a significant, highly accessible book of considerable value to scholars and advanced students."--<em>History</em><p></p><br>"Tony Harkins has gone deeper, understood a wider range of pop-culture materials, and analyzed more insightfully the twentieth-century image of the American 'hillbilly' than any other scholar in this or the previous century. My hat's not only off to him. It's way up in the air!"-- Jerry Williamson, author of <em>Hillbillyland</em><p></p><br>"This is an impressively researched and meticulously documented study of one of the pervasive terms in American popular culture, 'hillbilly,' a concept that has both reflected and shaped public views of southern white working people. Students in my field of research, Southern Folk Music, will obviously profit from this beautifully written work, but anyone intrigued by the ways in which stereotypes have clouded our perceptions will want to read this book."-Bill C. Malone, author of <em>Country Music, U.S.A.</em><p></p><br>"Harkins' <em>Hillbilly</em> is an intriguing and wide-ranging study of a strangely enduring American type, one both loved and despised but still nationally (if not internationally) recognized. From Snuffy Smith and Li'l Abner to <em>The Real McCoys</em> and the Clampett clan, Harkins discusses how the hillbilly image itself has remained relatively unchanged, while its meaning has evolved in response to broader social, economic, and cultural transformations in American society."--Erika Doss, University of Colorado<p></p><br>"Distilling truths and untruths about a great American archetype, <em>Hillbilly</em> is insightful and respectful without draining out all the fun. Anthony Harkins writes entertaining yet sophisticated analysis, free of ten-dollar words and other academic moonshine."--Scott A.

This legal document puts you in control of who inherits your property and who would take care of your children if it were ever necessary. Without a will, state law determines these issues. Your will also allows you to name an executor (sometimes called a &#x201c;personal representative&#x201d;) to carry out our wishes. And you can appoint a trusted person to manage property left to young people. <br><br> <b>Your Revocable Living Trust</b> Use a living trust to save your loved ones time and money after you die. Like a will, you can use a living trust to determine who gets your property, and the property that passes through your living trust can be transferred directly to beneficiaries without going through costly and time-consuming probate procedures. Compared to wills, living trusts tend to be more complicated to set up and maintain, but many people find that the benefits of having a trust outweigh the extra work. If you make a living trust, you will still need a back-up will. <br><br> <b>Your Health Care Directive </b><br> Spare your loved ones difficult decisions by laying out your wishes for medical care (living will) and naming someone to carry out your instructions (power of attorney for health care). <br><br> <b>Your Durable Power of Attorney for Finances</b> <br>A durable power of attorney ensures that someone you trust (called your "agent" or "attorney-in-fact") will be on hand to manage the many practical, financial tasks that will arise if you become incapacitated. For example, bills must be paid, bank deposits must be made and someone must handle insurance and benefits paperwork. In most cases, a durable power of attorney for finances is the best way to take care of tasks like these. <br><br> <b>Your Final Arrangements</b><br> Plan a funeral or other ceremony and ease the burden on your loved ones. Describe your preferences for burial, cremation, memorials, obituaries and more. <br> <br><b>Documents for Your Executor</b><br> These forms, checklists, instructions and resources will help your executor with the difficult job of wrapping up your estate after you die. <br> <br><b>Information for Caregivers and Survivors</b><br> Organize your information so that your survivors don't have to. Use these documents to give them details about everything from bank accounts, to passwords, to the names of people you'd like contacted in the event of your illness or death. <br> <br><b>Letter to Survivors</b><br> Use the Letter to Survivors to leave your loved ones detailed explanations about your decisions. For example, you may want to let them know why you made certain gifts or named a particular person to be your executor. You can also use your letter to leave some general thoughts about your life. <br> <br><b>Personal Finance Documents</b><br> Over a dozen forms let you handle common financial situations, such as lending or borrowing money between friends or family, creating a bill of sale, and authorizing someone to take care of a specific financial task on your behalf. <br> <br><b>Home &amp; Family Documents</b><br> Practical forms you can use every day to help run your home and keep your family safe, including authorizations, agreements, and child and elder care forms. <br><br> * Estate planning documents not valid in Louisiana or U.S. Territories. <br> <i>Quicken WillMaker Plus 2019</i> is designed to be used only in the United States of America, and its estate planning documents are not valid in Louisiana or U.S. Territories.</p><p><i>Quicken Willmaker Plus 2019 Edition</i> is the absolute easiest way to create your own legally valid estate plan.

Now he offers the fourth title in the latter, a decade-by-decade history of American musicals, following on the heels of Coming Up Roses, about the 1950s. Despite Mordden's authoritative, scholarly approach, the book sings with stylish syncopation and chatty humor. The evolution and transition of 1960s Broadway was signaled by the failure of Irving Berlin's Mr. President, Noel Coward's fading glory (Sail Away) and the beginning of The Fantasticks' four-decade run. New concepts emerged, and fresh talents like Bob Fosse and Stephen Sondheim took center stage. With Cabaret in 1966, "the new age begins." Darker themes were introduced in Man of La Mancha, What Makes Sammy Run? and Golden Boy. Detailing the decade's innovations, Mordden tosses in fascinating bits of theatrical lore and history. Hits (Funny Girl) and flops (Sophie) are deftly described with wit, panache and a clever, novelistic eye. Mordden never misses a cue, covering everything from off-Broadway (The Threepenny Opera) to the English musical. Regrettably, the lack of boldface subheads decreases the book's value as a research tool, since many titles are lost in the multitude. Still, scholars will be as anxious to read it as theater enthusiasts. (Nov. 5)Forecast: Readers will wish a CD had been packaged with this tuneful history, but booksellers can fill that gap by displaying the book with appropriate albums. Mordden's regular readers who queue at the TKTS box office will line up at stores for this one.<p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Dali: The Salvador Dali Museum Collection</h2><p>Surveys paintings, drawings, and watercolors from each stage of Dali&#39;s career, and discusses the themes of his major works</p><p>A leading Dali scholar, Robert S. Lubar is Associate Professor of Fine Arts, New York University, Institute of Fine Arts, where he received his PhD. He has published extensively on modern Spanish artists, especially Dali and Picasso. He has taught at the Univesitat de Girona, Spain, Princeton University, and the University at Delaware. His essays have appeared in many publications including Picasso and The Spanish Tradition (Yale 1996) and the exhibition catalog for Early Picasso at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, 1997.Concentrating solely on the art, this impressive study chronicles the lengthy career of the controversial Catalan painter Salvador Dali (1904-89). The major portion of the book is devoted to over 150 illustrations, most in color, of the oil paintings, watercolors, and drawings from the Morse Collection of the Dali Museum, in St. Petersburg, Florida. The earlier works show the influences of Impressionism, Cubism, and Surrealism; religious and historical themes occur frequently, and the haunting representations of hallucinatory and realistic images set against bleak landscapes are fascinating and disturbing. Art scholar Robert S. Lubar succinctly analyzes Dali's unique style and its relationship with Modernism. A foreword by art collector A. Reynolds Morse, notes, and chronology complete the volume. This broad overview attests to Dali's greatness and is an excellent choice for all collections.<br><i>- Joan Levin, Indian Trails P.L., Wheeling, Ill.</i><br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Calculus of Happiness: How a Mathematical Approach to Life Adds Up to Health, Wealth, and Love</h2><p><p><b>How math holds the keys to improving one's health, wealth, and love life</b></p><p>What's the best diet for overall health and weight management?

In recent years, however, the historical value of the <em>Acts</em> has come into question. Many scholars argue that, despite the accuracy of many details, the text as a whole reflects the interests of Luke rather than objective reality.<br> <br> This book presents a completely new, and much more vivid and dramatic, account of the life of Paul than any before. While continuing to give consideration to the <em>Acts</em>, Murphy-O'Connor reconstructs the apostle's life--from his childhood in Taursus and his years as a student in Jerusalem, to the successes and failures of his ministry--from his own writings. Reinforcing his critical analysis of Paul's letters with close attention to archaeology and contemporary texts, Murphy-O'Connor not only charts Paul's movements, but extracts a new understanding of his motives and the social and cultural aspects of his ministry. Most important of all, this biography transforms a fountain of theological ideas into a human being.<br></p><p><br>Jerome Murphy-O'Connor is Professor of the New Testament at the �cole Biblique et Arch�ologique Fran�aise, Jerusalem. He is a world expert on Paul, and a contributor both to the <em>Oxford Companion to the Bible</em>, and the forthcoming <em>Oxford Bible Commentary</em>.<br>A dry historical tome that would be more aptly titled ``Paul: A Cultural History.'' The difficulties of doing ancient biography are compounded when one of the two major sources available is believed to be historically unreliable and corrupt. One of New Testament scholar Murphy-O'Connor's primary objectives is to demonstrate why Luke's account of Paul's life, contained in the Book of Acts, is an inaccurate basis for biography. Point well taken, but where to go from there? The author relies heavily on Paul's own letters, but the portrait available from them is incomplete at best. Paul revealed relatively little about his personal life, preferring to call attention to his mission. Some surprising hypotheses do emerge from this work. First, Murphy-O'Connor conjectures that Paul was not a bachelor, but a widower who had lost his family in some sort of tragedy. The psychological evidence for this is slim, and the historical evidence is nonexistent. Much stronger are the author's deductions about the letters themselves; he makes an excellent case for 2 Thessalonians as a genuine Pauline letter, a minority opinion among New Testament scholars. He also challenges Rome as the traditional site of Paul's imprisonment and demonstrates why Ephesus was a far more logical locale. The primary contribution of the book is not that it is a biography of Paul, but that it opens the door to Paul's world through geography, Roman history, and Jewish-Christian conflict. Unfortunately, the prose is mired in academic passivity and such dense phrases as ``abstracting from the spurious clarity of the philological argument.'' The book is so weighed down with cultural history that there is relatively little about Paul himself, and what there is seems to be mostly speculation. Acts, though historically imprecise, makes for a much better story. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Spies were imprisoned or murdered, adultery unmasked, and battles lost because of faulty or intercepted secret communications. Yet, successfully hidden writing helped save lives, win battles, and ensure privacy; occasionally it even changed the course of history.<br><br> Kristie Macrakis combines a storyteller's sense of drama with a historian's respect for evidence in this page-turning history of intrigue and espionage, love and war, magic and secrecy. From the piazzas of ancient Rome to the spy capitals of the Cold War, Macrakis's global history reveals the drama and importance of invisible ink. From Ovid's advice to use milk for illicit love notes, to John Gerard's dramatic escape from the Tower of London aided by orange juice ink messages, to al-Qaeda's hidden instructions in pornographic movies, this book presents spellbinding stories of secret messaging that chart its evolution in sophistication and its impact on history.

The topics are presented in tutorial format with exercises at the end of each chapter to reinforce the concepts covered. It is richly illustrated with computer screen shots throughout. Above all, this text is designed to help the reader expand their creative talents and communicate their ideas through the graphics language.</p> <p>Because it is easier to learn new information if you have a reason for learning it, this textbook discusses design intent while you are learning Creo Parametric. At the same time, it shows how knowledge covered in basic engineering courses such as statics, dynamics, strength of materials, and design of mechanical components can be applied to design. You do not need an engineering degree nor be working toward a degree in engineering to use this textbook. Although FEA (Finite Element Analysis) is used in this textbook, its theory is not covered.</p> <p>The first two chapters of this book describe the design process. The meat of this text, learning the basic Creo Parametric software, is found in Chapters 3 through 6. Chapters 7, 8, and 12 deal with dimensioning and tolerancing an engineering part. Chapters 9 and 10 deal with assemblies and assembly drawings. Chapter 11 deals with family tables used when similar parts are to be designed or used. Chapter 13 is an introduction to Creo Simulate and FEA.</p> <p><b>Table of Contents</b></p> 1. Computer Aided Design <br>2. Introduction <br>3. Sketcher <br>4. Extrusions <br>5. Revolves <br>6.

The fact that it is edited is an essential aspect of its success. Skilful cutting preserves key speeches and retains the work&#39;s shape and momentum while avoiding passages that may have less relevance to modern audiences. The edited original text is accompanied by a modern English translation throughout. This simplified version puts Shakespeare&#39;s work into understandable, contemporary language. It goes for clarity of expression rather than poetic effect and is a brilliant support for those who would otherwise struggle to comprehend Shakespeare&#39;s verse. Both Shakespeare&#39;s text and its modern translation are presented throughout in comic book style. The vivid two colour illustrations have their own intrinsic appeal, but also provide important information about setting, historical context, atmosphere and character. The Shakespeare Comic Book Series has become an established and popular part of the English curriculum in many UK schools. Mainly used by teachers at KS 2-4, the comic book approach to his work has been described by one teacher as &#39;the perfect introduction to Shakespeare.&#39;</p><p>Simon Greaves is a writer, illustrator and yurt maker.

Badge and gun hidden, he arrived posing as the new schoolteacher, and his first order of business was to bring the rough ranchers' children under control. To that end, he called on Maddie Chancelor, the local postmistress, whose younger brother was in firm need of discipline.<br>Sam wasn't sure what to expect&nbsp;&#x2014; but it was definitely not this graceful woman whose prim, proper stance was so at odds with the fire in her eyes. Working undercover to capture a dangerous band of rustlers and train robbers was a job that had always kept him apart from other people. He was a man with his heart firmly in check&nbsp;&#x2014; until Maddie. Now she was unwittingly tempting him down a path he'd sworn he'd never travel.</p><p><b>Linda LaelMiller</b> is a #1&nbsp;<i>New YorkTimes</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>USA TODAY </i>bestselling author of morethan&nbsp;one hundred&nbsp; novels.

Linda exploresthat turbulent time in <i>The Yankee Widow.</i><p><i>Haven,Arizona Territory<br> Fall, 1903</i></p> <p>THE PINT-SIZE CULPRITS, heretofore gathered around the well, scattered for the brush as soon as Sam O'Ballivan rode into the schoolyard on his nameless horse, but he'd seen enough to know they were up to no good. He caught glimpses of bowl-cut hair, denim trousers and chambray shirts as they fled. Pigtails, too, and a flash of red calico, bright as a cardinal rousted from the low branches of a white oak tree in winter.With a disgusted shake of his head, Sam reined in and dismounted, leaving the gelding to stand untethered while he strode toward the scene of recent mischief.A part of his mind stayed behind, with the animal&nbsp;&#x2014; it was newly acquired, that horse, and the two of them had yet to form a proper acquaintance. All during the long ride south from his ranch just outside Flagstaff, he'd been too busy cogitating on the complexities of this new assignment to consider much of anything else, going over Major John Blackstone's orders again and again in his head, sorting and sifting, weighing and measuring.</p> <p>"Hold on," he called.The bucket rope was taut and quivering, and he recalled this particular trick from his own youth.</p> <p>A male voice echoed from the depths of the water hole, a shambling train of plaintive syllables rattling along a track of hopeful goodwill. Sam recognized the keynote as relief.</p> <p><i>"I find myself in&nbsp;&#x2014; obvious difficulties&nbsp;&#x2014; and will&nbsp;&#x2014; be profoundly grateful for any assistance&nbsp;&#x2014;"</i></p> <p>"Hold on," Sam repeated, the words underlaid with a sigh. He was powerfully built&nbsp;&#x2014; like a brick shithouse, the boys in the bunkhouse liked to say&nbsp;&#x2014; and seldom moved quickly, except in a fight or when called upon to draw his .45. He secured the rope with his left hand and reached for the crank with the other, peering downward.</p> <p>All he could make out, even squinting, were the soles of two small, booted feet, bound at the ankles with what looked like baling twine. Here was a dainty fellow, for sure and certain&nbsp;&#x2014; and most likely the incompetent schoolmaster Sam had come to relieve of his duties.</p> <p>"I'm all right!" the teacher called cheerfully from the pit. "Thomas P. Singleton, here!"</p> <p>Sam felt chagrined that given the circumstances, he hadn't thought to inquire after the man's well-being right off, but kept cranking. He was a practical man, given to engaging the crisis at hand and dealing with the conversational aspects of the situation later.</p> <p>"That's good, Mr. Singleton," he said belatedly, and when the ankles came within reach, he let go of the handle and grabbed for them with both hands. Poor Tom resembled a trussed gander, plucked and ready for the stew pot, and he didn't weigh much more than one, either.</p> <p>Sam hauled him out of the well and let him plop to the tinder-dry grass like a fresh-caught trout. He wasn't wet, so the water must be low.</p> <p>Crouching, Sam pulled out his pocketknife and commenced to cutting the twine.The teacher's thin red hair stood straight up on his head, wild and crackling with static, as though it didn't subscribe to the law of gravity.The face beneath it was narrow, with pointy features and blue, watery eyes.The girlish lips curled into a self-deprecating smile.</p> <p>"My replacement, I presume?" he asked, feeling for what turned out to be his pocket watch, still safe at the end of its tarnished chain, and tucking it away again with a relieved pat. Singleton was certainly a resilient sort; the way he acted, anybody would have thought the pair of them had just sat themselves down to a grand and sociable supper in some fancy Eastern restaurant instead of meeting the way they had. "I must say, your arrival was timely indeed."</p> <p>Still resting on his haunches, Sam nodded in acknowledgment. "Sam O'Ballivan," he said, though he doubted an introduction was necessary. Up at Flagstaff, he'd heard all about the schoolmaster, and he figured the reverse was probably true.With a few pertinent details excepted, of course.</p> <p>Singleton rubbed his rope-chafed wrists to restore the circulation, but he showed no inclination to stand up just yet. Poor little fella must have had noodles for legs, Sam reflected, after hanging upside down in the well like that."Call me Tom," he said affably."I am much obliged for your quick action on my behalf."</p> <p>Sam let one corner of his mouth quirk upward. He was sparing with a smile; like names for horses, they meant something to him, and he gave them out only when he was good and ready. He made a stalwart friend, when he had a high opinion of somebody,but he took his time deciding such matters. He knew a little aboutTom Singleton, much of it hearsay, but as to whether he liked the man or not...well, the vote was still untallied.</p> <p>Small feet rustled the bushes nearby and a giggle or two rode the warm afternoon breeze.Valiantly, Singleton pretended not to hear, but there was a flush pulsing on his cheekbones. It had to be hard on a small man's dignity, being cranked up out of a schoolyard well by a big one, hired to take over his job. Sam wanted to tread lightly around what was left of Single-ton's pride.</p> <p>"You hurting anywhere?" Sam asked, rising to his feet and scanning the schoolyard.<i> Just you wait,</i> he told the hidden miscreants silently.</p> <p>"Fit as a fiddle!" Singleton insisted. He tried to get up then, but Sam saw that he was fixing to crumple and withheld his hand out of regard for the fellow's self-respect. Sure enough, he went down.</p> <p>"Best sit a spell," Sam said.</p> <p>Another bush shivered, off to his left&nbsp;&#x2014; No time like the present, he thought, and waded in, snatching up one of the offenders by his shirt collar and dragging him out into the open.The giggles turned to gasps and there was some powerful shrub-shaking as the rest of the gang lit out for safer ground. "And your name would be?"</p> <p>The lad looked to be around twelve or thirteen, with a cap of chestnut-brown hair and strange, whiskey-colored eyes peering, at once scared and defiant, out of a freckled face. His clothes were plain, but of good sturdy quality,and he wore shoes,which marked him as somebody's pride and joy.</p> <p>"Terran Chancelor," he answered, clearly begrudging the information. His gaze darted briefly to Singleton, who was just summoning up the gumption for another attempt at gaining his feet, and the sly pleasure in the kid's face made Sam want to shake him.</p> <p>Forbearing, Sam held him suspended, so the toes of his fine mail-order shoes just barely brushed the grass. "You the leader of this bunch of outlaws?" he asked.</p> <p>"No," Chancelor snapped. "Put me down!"</p> <p>Sam hoisted him an inch or two higher. "Maybe you'd like to hang upside down in the well for a while," he mused. It was a bluff, but the kid didn't need to know that. His eyes widened and he went a shade paler behind that constellation of freckles.</p> <p>"I hope you're not the new schoolmaster,"Terran Chancelor said with brave disdain. Sam wasn't sure how smart the kid was, but he had to credit him with grit.</p> <p>He allowed himself a slow, wicked grin. "Abandon hope, all ye who enter here," he quoted.</p> <p>Chancelor frowned, gnawed at his lower lip. "What does <i>that</i> mean?" he asked, peevish."Sounds like something out of some high-falutin' book."</p> <p>Sam released his hold on the boy's shirt, watched as he dropped, swayed and found his balance. "It means, young Mr. Chancelor, that when you sit down at your desk bright and early tomorrow morning, here in the hallowed halls of learning, I'll be standing in front of the blackboard."</p> <p>"Well,<i> hell,</i>" the kid complained.</p> <p>Sam suppressed a grin. "Peculiar that you should mention Hades," he said evenly. "That quote you just asked about is carved over the gate."</p> <p>The boy's eyes widened again, but his color was high with fresh temper. He darted another glance at Singleton. "We were just having a little fun after school let out for the day, that's all. No harm done."</p> <p>"I guess that depends on your viewpoint," Sam said mildly. "Whether or not there was any harm done, I mean.You tell your friends that I'll be happy to give any or all of them the same perspective Mr. Singleton here just enjoyed, if they're curious about how it feels."</p> <p>Chancelor narrowed his eyes, looked as if he might be deciding whether he ought to spit in Sam's face. Fortunately for him, he didn't pursue that inclination.<i> Unfortunately</i> for him, he chose to run off at the mouth instead.</p> <p>"You wouldn't dare," he said.</p> <p>Quick as if he'd been wrestling a calf to the ground for branding, Sam hooked an arm around the boy's middle, tipped him over the rim of the well and caught a firm hold on his ankles. "There's where you're wrong, young Mr. Chancelor," he replied.</p> <p>"My sister will have your hide for this!" the boy yelled, but his voice quavered as it bounced off the cold stone walls.</p> <p>Sam chuckled. Singleton stared at him in horrified admiration. "He's right, you know,"Tom whispered earnestly. "Maddie Chancelor's got a tongue on her. She'll flay you to the bone."</p> <p>"That right?" Sam asked. Bracing his elbows against the edge of the well, he let the kid dangle.</p> <p>"The blood is probably rushing to his head," Singleton advised fretfully.</p> <p>"Good for his brain," Sam said companionably.</p> <p>"Get me out of here!"Terran sputtered, squirming.<i> "Right now!"</i></p> <p>"I wouldn't flail around like that, if I were you," Sam counseled. "Hell of a thing if you came out of those splendid boots of yours and took a spill. Fall like that, you'd probably break your fool neck."</p> <p>The boy heeded Sam's advice and went still. "What do you want?" he asked, sounding just shy of reasonable.</p> <p>"For a start," Sam answered, "a sincere apology."</p> <p>"What do I have to say 'sorry' to <i>you</i> for?"</p> <p>Sam wondered idly about Maddie Chancelor and what kind of influence she might have in this little cowpattie of a town, plopped right along the border between Mexico and the Arizona Territory like an egg on a griddle. If she was anything like her brother, she must be a caution, as well as a shrew.</p> <p>"Not a thing," he replied at his leisure. "But a kindly word to Mr. Singleton here wouldn't go amiss."</p> <p>Sam felt a quiver of rage rise right up the length of that boy, then along the rope, like grounded lightning coursing back through a metal rod.</p> <p>"All right!" Chancelor bellowed. "I'm sorry!"</p> <p>"I'm sorry, Mr. Singleton," Sam prompted.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, Mr. Singleton," the boy repeated. His tone was neither as dutiful nor as earnest as it might have been, but Sam yanked him up anyhow and set him hard on his feet. The fury in the kid's eyes could have singed the bristles off a full-grown boar, but he held his tongue.</p> <p>There might be hope for this one yet, Sam concluded silently, folding his arms as he regarded the furious youth.</p> <p>"Go home and tell your sister," Sam said,"that the new schoolmaster will be stopping by shortly to discuss the calamitous state of your character."</p> <p>The boy glowered at him in barely contained outrage, fists clenched, eyes fierce. "She'll be expecting you." He spat the words, simultaneously leaping backward, out of reach, ready to run."Don't bother to unpack your gear.You won't be around here long."</p> <p>Sam raised an eyebrow, took a step toward the kid.</p> <p>He turned and fled down the road Sam had just traveled, arms pumping at his sides, feet raising little puffs of dust.</p> <p>By then, Singleton had recovered his composure. "You're in for some trouble," he said with friendly regret, consulting his pocket watch and starting for the schoolhouse. "Might as well show you around, though. I have an hour before the stage leaves for Tucson."</p> <p>Leaving his horse to graze on the sweet grass, Sam followed. "Where will I find the formidable Maddie Chancelor?" he asked.</p> <p>Singleton mounted three plank steps and pushed open the schoolhouse door, which creaked ominously on its hinges. "She's the postmistress, and she runs the mercantile, too," he answered with a note of bleak resignation."When she hears how you hung young Terran headfirst down the well, she's not going to like it.They're alone in the world, the pair of them, and she protects that little scoundrel like a she-bear guarding a cub."</p> <p>Sam digested the information as he crossed the threshold into a small, square room.There were long tables, rough-hewn, with benches, facing a blackboard on the east wall.A potbellied stove stood in one corner, with wood neatly stacked alongside.A few reading and ciphering primers lined a shelf next to the teacher's desk, and the place smelled of chalk. Dust motes danced in the light coming in through the high, narrow windows.</p> <p>Singleton looked around wistfully, sighed.</p> <p>Sam felt a twinge of sympathy, wondering if a lone incident had spurred those little hellions to act, or if anarchy was the order of the day around here. He wasn't about to ask, figuring the man had been through enough mortification as it was, but he'd have put his money on the latter.</p> <p>"Your private quarters are back here," Singleton said after a long and melancholy pause, making for an inside door. "It isn't much, but the roof keeps out the rain, and there's a decent bed and a cookstove."</p> <p>Sam was used to sleeping on the ground, wrapped up in a bedroll.The accommodations sounded downright luxurious to him.</p> <p>"Not that you'll want to stay long, even if Miss Chancelor doesn't get you fired," Singleton added.Two carpetbags waited at the foot of the bed and he stooped to fetch them up while Sam surveyed his new home.</p> <p>"Looks like it'll do," he decided. The more he heard about Maddie Chancelor, the more he wanted to meet her.</p> <p>Singleton stooped to pick up the satchels. Smiled gamely. "Good luck, Mr. O'Ballivan," he said. "And thank you again for your help."</p> <p>"Good luck to you," Sam replied, a little embarrassed by the other man's gratitude.Anybody worth his bacon would have stepped in, in a circumstance like that.</p> <p>Singleton set down one of the bags long enough to shake Sam's hand. "May God be with you," he added in parting.Then he crossed the room, opened the rear door and left, without looking back.</p> <p>MADDIE CHANCELOR was measuring flour into a tin canister to fill Mrs. Ezra <br>T. Burke's weekly grocery order, when Terran burst into the store, shirt-tail out, hair rumpled, face aflame.</p> <p>"The new teacher's here," he blurted before she could ask if he'd been fighting again, "and he just tried his best to kill me!"</p> <p>Instant alarm swelled within Maddie's breast, fair cutting off her wind, and her hands trembled as she set the scoop aside on the counter."<i>Kill</i> you? What on earth...?"</p> <p>"He would have drowned me in the well if I hadn't got the best of him," Terran insisted.</p> <p>"Drowned you in the&nbsp;&#x2014;"</p> <p>"Well,"Terran finished in furious triumph.</p> <p>Maddie untied her apron laces as she rounded the counter to examine her younger brother for injuries. He looked sound, and for someone who had nearly been murdered by drowning, he was remarkably dry, too.</p> <p>"Tell me what happened," she said, grateful, for once, that the mercantile was empty.</p></p><h2>Robert de Cotte and the Perfection of Architecture in Eighteenth-Century France</h2><p>Robert de Cotte (1656/7-1735), Principal Architect to the King of France, was among the most prominent European architects of his day. In a period that witnessed the ascendancy of Paris over Rome as the international center of fashion, princes and nobles in Germany, Italy, and Spain eagerly commissioned him to design buildings in the French court style. Robert Neuman provides the first comprehensive examination of fifty or so building projects by de Cotte, which include such extant works as the H�tel d'Estr�es, Paris; Schloss Poppelsdorf, Bonn; and his universally acknowledged masterpiece, the Palais Rohan, Strasbourg.<br><br>After describing de Cotte's training and the professional context in which he worked, Neuman offers a thorough survey of de Cotte's output. For each commission, he recreates the actual design process, showing how de Cotte manipulated an accepted vocabulary of architectural forms to meet the patron's specific requirements. De Cotte's own drawings, many reproduced here for the first time, and quotations from a wide variety of contemporary writings vividly supplement the case histories. Beautifully illustrated, Neuman's much-needed book reveals de Cotte as an innovative and strikingly modern architect.</p><p>Robert Neuman is associate professor in the Department of Art History at Florida State University.</p><h2>Collins Spanish Concise Dictionary, 6th Edition (Collins Language)</h2><p>Revised and updated with a special emphasis on computing terms, this concise edition of the <em>Collins Spanish Dictionary</em> offers comprehensive coverage of today&#x2019;s language with over 190,000 entries and translations, and a comprehensive grammar supplement that teaches how to speak and write in fluent, natural Spanish.

First, take an outsider to the system, Insoo Kim Berg, who has a vision and a solution-focused model. Add an insider, Susan Kelly, who understands the system. Spend many hours with CPS workers in the field, learning from them and helping them make the shift from a deficit perspective to a collaborative model that emphasizes strengths and solutions. Envision and implement change throughout the system. Celebrate small successes on the way to building family self-sufficiency and integrity.<br><br> This recipe for reforming child protective services is being followed in many public child welfare agencies, with growing success. In <em>Building Solutions</em> the authors explain how to conceptualize, implement, and sustain this hopeful and positive frame in a daily practice for dedicated frontline workers as well as for those in supervision, management, and administration.<br><br> The book has two parts. In the first, the authors put child protective services in context, introducing the system and their new approach, giving a brief history of child protection in the United States, and setting the stage for change. In the second part, the authors walk readers through the nuts and bolts of implementation, from the first phone call to case closure&#x2015;including discussions about placing a child out of the home. Berg and Kelly also discuss supervision, consultation, and ongoing training, as well as their vision of the future of CPS.<br><br> This book is not a manual; it is a challenge to step out of the traditional CPS "box" and think differently&#x2015;to create client-driven services that make sense. The authors challenge CPS administrators, supervisors, and workers to begin conversations about how the system can be more helpful and respectful to the families so that the parents can get what they need to care for their children.

Visit www.luminosoa.org to learn more.<br><br><i>Precarious Claims&nbsp;</i>tells the human story behind the bureaucratic process of fighting for justice in the U.S. workplace. The global economy has fueled vast concentrations of wealth that have driven a demand for cheap and flexible labor. Workplace violations such as wage theft, unsafe work environments, and discrimination are widespread in low-wage industries such as retail, restaurants, hospitality, and domestic work, where jobs are often held by immigrants and other vulnerable workers. How and why&nbsp;do&nbsp;these workers, despite enormous barriers, come forward to seek justice, and what happens once they do?&nbsp;Based on extensive fieldwork in Northern California, Gleeson investigates the array of gatekeepers with whom workers must negotiate in the labor standards enforcement bureaucracy and, ultimately, the limited reach of formal legal protections. The author also tracks how workplace injustices&#x2014;and the arduous process of contesting them&#x2014;carry long-term effects on their everyday lives. Workers sometimes win, but their chances are precarious at best.</p><p>"This book provides a unique perspective on administrative law and adjudication in the field of employment protection. It allows the reader to experience the difficulties in rights adjudication from the perspective of immigrant workers who attempt to navigate the administrative systems that are charged with conferring rights. Gleeson takes the reader through an explanation of the system as it is supposed to work and the system as it actually works, and asks the questions that lawyers must learn to ask when they think about whether rights in the abstract can translate to rights on the ground."&#x2014;Leticia Saucedo, Professor of Law, University of California Davis<br> "Gleeson presents a unique view into the system and bureaucracy that workers have to navigate in order to make any claims when their rights are violated at work. Using surveys and in-depth interviews with workers, community-based support organizations, and advocacy groups, combined with participant observation, Gleeson shows that the path to justice for many workers is often experienced as long, challenging, and inconclusive."&#x2014;Hector R. Cordero-Guzman, School of Public and International Affairs, Baruch College of the City University of New York<br> &nbsp;<p>"This exceptional book examines how immigrant workers understand and mobilize their rights through a fractured and complex administrative bureaucracy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Drawing on extensive observations and interviews with immigrant workers,&nbsp;Gleeson&nbsp;masterfully demonstrates how institutional inequality weakens employment rights through workplace power imbalances, bureaucratic procedures for claiming rights, and broader shifts toward precarious work in the global economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;A must read for those interested in how law and society interact in the struggle for justice among immigrant workers."&#x2014;Catherine Albiston, Professor of Law and Sociology, University of California Berkeley</p>&nbsp;<b>Shannon Gleeson</b> is Associate Professor of Labor Relations, Law, and History at the School of Industrial and Labor Relations, Cornell University.</p><h2>Selected Poems of Marina Tsvetayeva (English and Russian Edition)</h2><p>Representative selections of the Russian poet&#39;s work reveal her technical skill and lyrical power</p><p>Text: English, Russian (translation)</p><h2>The Romance of the Forest (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>This novel, although not as well-known as Radcliffe&#39;s later works, is thought to represent her work at its best. More than just a work of suspense and mystery, it is a work of ideas--a discussion of the contrasts between hedonistic doctrines and a system of education and values.</p><p>Ann Radcliffe&#x2019;s <b>Romance of the Forest</b>, first published in 1791, is the epitome of the Gothic novel: a beautiful, orphaned heiress, a dashing hero, a dissolute, aristocratic villain and a ruined abbey deep in a great forest are combined by the author in a tale of suspense where danger lurks behind every secret trap-door. Reprinted four times between 1791 and 1795 and satirised as representative of the Gothic genre by Jane Austen in <b>Northanger Abbey</b>, Radcliffe&#x2019;s tense masterpiece, in which the heroine is afraid even to look in the mirror for fear of what she might see behind her, established her reputation as a writer and her brilliant descriptions of both characters and scenes serve to create the perfect atmosphere for a novel packed with emotional intensity.Chloe Chard is at University of Sheffield.</p><h2>Psychological Commentaries on the Teaching of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky, Volume 5</h2><p>The Psychological Commentaries on the teaching of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky by Maurice Nicoll are the best, most in depth and easiest to understand books on the subject of Gurdjieff's and Ouspensky's teachings. Everyone interested in Gurdjieff's and Ouspensky's teachings should read all five volumes. Regardless of what spiritual path a person is on, the psychological commentaries can be a big help because they detail on a day-to-day basis the obstacles the false personality creates and how to conquer and remove those obstacles. Very few books have ever been written that go into great detail exposing the tricks the imaginary I uses to prevent people from succeeding in their spiritual goals. The psychological commentaries do just that. The Psychological Commentaries is the classic work on the fundamental ideas of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky, expounded by one of their foremost students. The Commentaries, concerned with the immediate processes of applying certain principles in daily life, have come to be known and loved by entire generations of people interested in the ongoing evolution of psychological transformation. One of the leading British psychologists of his time, Maurice Nicoll was a student of Jung, Gurdjieff, and Ouspensky. At the latter's request, he devoted the last twenty years of his life to passing on the ideas he had received from his teachers. This devotion culminated in the five volumes of the Psychological Commentaries on the teaching of Gurdjieff &amp; Ouspensky. The ISBN's are: Volume One 978-0-9829651-5-3.

For professional photographers, chasing the light, waiting for it, sometimes helping it, and finally capturing it is a constant preoccupation &#x2015; and for some an obsession.</p> <p>Drawing on four decades of doing just this, Michael Freeman takes a simple but practical approach to reacting to, and capturing photography&#x2019;s most important commodity.</p> <p>There are just three sections titled Waiting, Chasing, and Helping: Waiting explains the kinds of lighting that photographers can anticipate and plan for, while Chasing explores the transient, serendipitous light that photographers have to work quickly to exploit.

This book goes some way towards filling that requirement. It contains fifty gripping, often horrific, First World War episodes from the first month of the war to the last - all told in the words of participants: private soldiers, non-commissioned officers and infantry officers - all of them at the sharp end. You will endure with them the German bombardments and attacks and share their unimaginable experiences.<br>These experiences are drawn from numerous unpublished or obscure contemporary sources, each piece with its own introduction and biographical notes on the author. There is also an outline of the arrangements of the army medical services in the war, an account of the work of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and a useful glossary of trench and military terms.</p><p></p><h2>Status Update: Celebrity, Publicity, and Branding in the Social Media Age</h2><p><b>Social media, once heralded as revolutionary and democratic, have instead proved exclusionary and elitist</b><br><br> Social media technologies such as YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook promised a new participatory online culture. Yet,&nbsp;technology insider Alice Marwick contends in this insightful&nbsp;book, &#x201c;Web 2.0&#x201d; only encouraged a preoccupation with status and attention. Her original research&#x2014;which includes conversations with entrepreneurs, Internet celebrities, and Silicon Valley journalists&#x2014;explores the culture and ideology of San Francisco&#x2019;s tech community in the period between the dot com boom and the App store, when the city was the world&#x2019;s center of social media development.&nbsp;Marwick argues that early revolutionary goals have failed to materialize: while many continue to view social media as democratic, these technologies instead turn users into marketers and self-promoters, and leave technology companies poised to violate privacy and to prioritize profits over participation. Marwick analyzes status-building techniques&#x2014;such as self-branding, micro-celebrity, and life-streaming&#x2014;to show that Web 2.0 did not provide a cultural revolution, but only furthered inequality and reinforced traditional social stratification, demarcated by race, class, and gender.</p><p><b>Alice E. Marwick</b> is assistant professor, communication and media studies, Fordham University, and the director of the Donald McGannon Communication Research Center. She lives in New York City.<p>"Marwick makes a compelling case that the rhetoric does not always match the reality, particularly when it comes to social media."&#x2014;Ravi Mattu, <i>Financial Times</i></p><br>"A must-read for anyone interested in the culture of the tech world and in the techniques of status-building in contemporary digital society."&#x2014;Finola Kerrigan, <i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i><br>"[Marwick is] a keen ethnographer of Silicon Valley."&#x2014;Sue Halpern, <i>New York Review of Books</i><br>"Marwick brilliantly gets beneath the shiny exterior of the Web 2.0 startup scene to uncover the ways in which geeks, entrepreneurs, and technologists use their creations to jockey for status and seek attention. This book is critical for all who care about or use social media."&#x2014;Danah Boyd, Microsoft Research<br>"With thoughtfulness and rigor, Marwick explains the importance of major social networks from cultural, economic, and human standpoints. <i>Status Update</i> offers a true understanding of what it means to share ourselves online, with a healthy skepticism about Silicon Valley&#x2019;s utopian&nbsp;promises."&#x2014;Anil Dash, ThinkUp<br>"San Francisco and environs have long been the home of American dreaming.

The principles behind these techniques are explained without resorting to complex mathematics, showing how the various techniques are implemented, when they are useful and when they are not. No particular programming language is assumed and the book does not tie itself to any of the software tools available. However, available tools and their uses are described, and program examples are given in Java.</p> <p>The lack of assumed prior knowledge makes this book ideal for any introductory courses in artificial intelligence or intelligent systems design, while the contemporary coverage means more advanced students will benefit by discovering the latest state-of-the-art techniques, particularly in intelligent agents and knowledge discovery.</p></p><p><p>Artificial Intelligence is often perceived as being a highly complicated, even frightening, subject in Computer Science. This view is compounded by books in this area being crowded with complex matrix algebra and differential equations &#x2013; until now. This book, evolving from lectures given to students with little knowledge of calculus, assumes no prior programming experience and demonstrates that most of the underlying ideas in intelligent systems are, in reality, simple and straightforward.&nbsp; The main attraction of the author's approach is in his deliberate de-emphasising of the maths &#x2013; just enough to give a valid treatment of the subject. This is what makes the underlying ideas in AI so much easier to understand. No wonder that this book has already been adopted by more than 250 universities around the world and translated into many languages.</p> <p>Are you looking for a genuinely lucid, introductory text for a course in AI or Intelligent Systems Design?

Greek philosophy, social Darwinism, New World colonialism, the eugenics movement, intelligence testing biases, and racial health fallacies are just a few of the topics he addresses. Graves argues that racism has persisted in our society because adequate scientific reasoning has not entered into the equation. He champions the scientific method and explains how we may properly ask scientific questions about the nature of population differentiation and how (if at all) we may correlate that diversity to observed human behavior. He also cautions us to think critically about scientific findings that have historically been misused in controversies over racial differences in intelligence heritability, criminal behavior, disease predisposition, and other traits. According to Graves, this country cannot truly address its racial problems until people understand the empirical evidence behind this truth that separate human races do not exist. With the biological basis for race removed, racism becomes an ideology, one that can and must be deleted.</p></p><p>In this groundbreaking book, Joseph Graves traces the development of thought about human genetic diversity.

Written for undergraduate, medical, veterinary, dental, and pharmacy students, it makes generous use of medical examples to illustrate points. The Fourth Edition has been extensively revised and updated. Innate immunity has undergone major revision to reflect this expanding and fast-moving field, and is nowdivided between two chapters: Chapter 2 &#34;Innate Immunity: The Immediate Response to Infection,&#34; which deals with complement and other soluble molecules of innate immunity such as antimicrobial peptides, and Chapter 3 &#34;Innate Immunity: The Induced Response to Infection,&#34; which deals mainly with the cellular response.Chapters 4-9 have been updated and material has been consolidated to eliminate repetition. Mucosal immunology has exploded as a field since the Third Edition was published, thus its coverage in chapter 10, now devoted to the topic, has been significantly expanded and updated. Also, more emphasis is placed on commensal microorganisms, particularly of the gut, and their interactions with the immune system.Immunological memory and the secondary immune response is now the first part of Chapter 11. The second part of this chapter, entitled &#34;Vaccination to Prevent Infectious Disease,&#34; will include new and more modern material. &#34;Bridging Innate and Adaptive Immunity&#34; will also have its own chapter. The remaining clinical chapters will be revised and updated with new immunotherapies, but their content and organization will remain largely the same. The Fourth Edition will be accompanied by an updated and greatly expanded question bank, as well as PowerPoints and JPEGs of all the figures in the text. &#34;--</p><p>...Appealing and relevant for those students who approach the study of the immune system through a clinical lens, including students of medicine, pharmacology, midwifery, or nursing; it would also be appropriate in an introductory immunology course..<br>113(3):345-6<br><b>&#x2013;Clinical Immunology, 2004</b></p><h2>The Communicator&#39;s Commentary: Judges, Ruth (COMMUNICATOR&#39;S COMMENTARY OT)</h2><p>For those on the firing line in the pulpits, classes, study groups, and Bible fellowship clusters, here is a distinctly different kind of commentary.

David Jackman, the author calls us to ponder critical questions about each of the Bible books at hand: Why is this book here in the Bible at all? What are its essential meaning and message? What would we not know about God if we did not have it? How should the structures and patterns of the text shape our own efforts to understand and communicate its truths? Each point in Jackman&#39;s deftly crafted outlines of Judges and Ruth will show how that segment of the text molded his message for his hearers.</p><p></p><h2>Journalism Next: A Practical Guide to Digital Reporting and Publishing</h2><p><p>The <strong>Third Edition </strong>of<strong> Journalism Next: A Practical Guide to Digital Reporting and Publishing </strong>is the most informed, practical, and succinct guide to digital technology for journalists.

Plath's unpublished letters are examined, as well as hand-written drafts of poems, typescripts of The Bell Jar and annotated copies of the books that most influenced her. The book also explores the ways in which Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath drafted their poems together and wrote poems in answer to each other. It is also the first volume to look at Plath's home-made art scrapbooks and to analyse the significance of the cover designs and marketing of Plath's work. </p><p> Tracy Brain is at University of Stirling.</p><p>Tracy Brain lectures in English and Creative Writing at Bath Spa University College. </p></p><h2>The Medieval World View: An Introduction</h2><p>The <em>Medieval World View</em>, Third Edition, presents the presuppositions of medieval society in a systematic fashion by integrating brief, self-contained selections from primary texts and carefully captioned photographs into a narrative of the medieval world and its foundations. <br><br>The text is divided into five parts. Treating both the classical and biblical antecedents of the Middle Ages and ending in Late Antiquity, Part One includes a thorough discussion of the monumental figure of St. Augustine. Part Two deals with the Mediterranean World, including Byzantium and Islam, and ending with the disintegration of the Roman Empire in the West. Part Three deals with the early Middle Ages, extending the narrative from the end of the Western Empire through the renaissance associated with the reign of Charlemagne. Part Four examines the High Middle Ages, following developments in the Church, in politics, in philosophy and theology, and in the arts from the twelfth century until the fourteenth. Part Five, an epilogue, traces the transition from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance, focusing primarily on the fourteenth century but also looking forward to the fifteenth century and beyond.<br>The third edition features two entirely new chapters, Chapter 5 on Byzantium and Chapter 6 on Islam.

Originally published in 1967 by Kulchur Press in an edition of 1,000, and out of print for more than 40 years, <i>Bean Spasms</i> is a book many have heard about but relatively few have seen, and which--until now--has been consequently shrouded in legend. The text is comprised of collaborations between poets Ted Berrigan and Ron Padgett, with further writings, illustrations and cover by artist and writer Joe Brainard. The three began collaborating in 1960, and kept a folder of their works titled &#x201c;Lyrical Bullets&#x201d; (a humorous homage to the well-known collaboration between Coleridge and Wordsworth, <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>). As Ron Padgett describes, in his introduction to this new facsimile edition, their collaborations included &#x201c;plays, a fictitious correspondence, a picaresque novel, goofy interviews and poems of various types and lengths, as well as mistranslations and parodies of each other&#x2019;s work and the work of others.&#x201d; Poet friends dropping by during writing sessions would also add lines, and although Berrigan and Padgett also contributed visuals, and Brainard contributed texts, all works in the book were intentionally left unattributed. Full of wild wit and joy in experimentation, competition and collaboration, <i>Bean Spasms</i> is a classic document of the New York School.</p><p>Berrigan and Padgett&#x2019;s collaboration is emblematic of the New York School culture&#x2019;s rebuttal of stodgy, self-serious American literature, but more importantly (thank God), it&#x2019;s fun&#x2015;whatever the duo was attempting, lofty or not, they were having a damn good time getting there, two artists riffing on their shared interests behind a typewriter, not unlike those Brainard monkeys on the second page.

How do we grasp a human and historical phenomenon characterized by such variety and contradiction? What is "Islamic" about Islamic philosophy or Islamic art? Should we speak of Islam or of islams? Should we distinguish the Islamic (the religious) from the Islamicate (the cultural)? Or should we abandon "Islamic" altogether as an analytical term?</p><p>In <i>What Is Islam?</i>, Shahab Ahmed presents a bold new conceptualization of Islam that challenges dominant understandings grounded in the categories of "religion" and "culture" or those that privilege law and scripture. He argues that these modes of thinking obstruct us from understanding Islam, distorting it, diminishing it, and rendering it incoherent.</p><p><i>What Is Islam?</i> formulates a new conceptual language for analyzing Islam. It presents a new paradigm of how Muslims have historically understood divine revelation&#x2015;one that enables us to understand how and why Muslims through history have embraced values such as exploration, ambiguity, aestheticization, polyvalence, and relativism, as well as practices such as figural art, music, and even wine drinking as Islamic. It also puts forward a new understanding of the historical constitution of Islamic law and its relationship to philosophical ethics and political theory.</p><p>A book that is certain to provoke debate and significantly alter our understanding of Islam, <i>What Is Islam?</i> reveals how Muslims have historically conceived of and lived with Islam as norms and truths that are at once contradictory yet coherent.</p></p><p><p>"Not merely field changing, but the boldest and best thing I have read in any field in years."<b>--Noah Feldman, Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law, Harvard Law School</b></p><p>"This book seeks to offer nothing short of a new way of looking at Islam, and it succeeds admirably at so doing.... I know of no book on the question of how to approach Islam that comes close to this study in its learning, breadth, and sophistication. It should be read not only by students and scholars of Islam, but by all those interested in the broad questions about conceptualizing religion, culture, and history that it raises."<b>--Muhammad Qasim Zaman, Princeton University</b></p><p>"Strikingly original, wide-ranging in its engagement, subtle in its interpretations, and hard-hitting in its conclusions, this book will certainly provoke debate for a number of years. Ahmed's assertions are provocative, his analysis is sharp, and his own solution is both strong and creative. The book lays out a new and capacious basis for thinking about an Islamic humanism. It reconstructs basic scholarly paradigms, ranges across all fields of the Islamic humanities--literature, history, philosophy, art, music, et cetera--and will create potentials for new streams of scholarship in all these fields."<b>--Engseng Ho, Professor of Cultural Anthropology and Professor of History, Duke University</b></p><p>"Lucid and compelling, beautifully constructed and powerful, important and brave. What Shahab Ahmed has accomplished in this book is to create a postcolonial ontology of Islam, one that provincializes the Euro-American categories of analysis that up to now have been applied to Islam, both by Western scholars as well as by scholars from the Muslim world who have appropriated these categories."<b>--Robert Wisnovsky, James McGill Professor of Islamic Philosophy, McGill University</b></p><b>Shahab Ahmed</b> (1966-2015) was postdoctoral associate in the Aga Khan Program for Islamic Architecture at Harvard University.</p><h2>Sedition: Everyday Resistance in the Soviet Union under Khrushchev and Brezhnev (Annals of Communism Series)</h2><p><p> This book explores Soviet prosecution records to tell the hidden story of ordinary citizens who were arrested for expressing discontent during the Khrushchev and Brezhnev years.</p></p><p><b>Vladimir A.

But though Suzanne Valadon (1865-1938) gloried in the carefree, bohemian artistic scene of Paris's Montmartre neighborhood in the 1880s and '90s, she really came into her own during the early years of the 20th century, when a passionate love for a man 20 years her junior led her to abandon a bourgeois husband and devote herself anew to art. She set to work with a renewed serenity but the same "unfeminine" boldness of line and earthy sexuality that had dismayed tradition-minded viewers from the beginning. It was she who taught her illegitimate son, Maurice Utrillo, to paint in a desperate attempt to wean him from his addiction to alcohol. His fame surpasses hers today in part because male art historians preferred salacious tales of Valadon's many loves and scandalous exploits to sober assessments of her artistic gifts. British art biographer June Rose restores Valadon to her proper place as a peer of the great postimpressionists in a readable narrative that puts her freewheeling personal life into perspective as a product of the same refusal to be constrained by conventional wisdom that fired her art. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>June Rose is the author of several biographies including <i>Modigliani: The Pure Bohemian</i>. While researching in Paris for her book on Modigliani, June Rose became interested in his friend Suzanne Valadon. She spent two years in France meeting artistic and family connections of the great Valadon and contributed a biographical essay to the catalogue for the 1996 Valadon exhibition in Martigny, Switzerland.

The Dr. Kevorkian trial of the 19th century, with a bit of O.J. Simpson mixed in for good measure, the scandal entranced nearly the entire population of the British Isles. Everyone had an opinion on the case--including esteemed poet and historical fabulist Robert Graves. <i>They Hanged My Saintly Billy</i> is true crime as only a true literary master could write it, with exquisitely rendered portraits of Palmer's era and milieu, told from the shifting perspectives of all who came into contact with the notorious doctor. Just as his renowned <i>I, Claudius</i> opened a window onto a case of history once thought to be closed, Graves's account of Palmer's life recasts the surgeon as a victim of yellow journalism and overzealous judges. But ultimately it's left up to the reader to decide whether or not Palmer's mother is in the right, or merely duped along with the rest of Palmer's supporters, when she laments: "Yes, they hanged my saintly Billy! He was a bit of a scamp right enough, but a good son to me; the best of the brood . . . and no murderer."<br>Seven Stories' Robert Graves Project spans 14 titles, and includes fiction and nonfiction, adult, young adult and children's books, in a striking new uniform design, with new introductions and afterwords. <i>They Hanged My Saintly Billy</i> joins our recent re-publication of <i>The Reader Over Your Shoulder</i>, <i>Ann at Highwood Hall</i>, <i>The Golden Fleece</i>, and <i>Homer's Daughter</i>.

This volume translates lectures 10&#x2013;28, following from the first nine lectures and a biography of the philosopher published in translation in a companion volume, <i>Olympiodorus: Life of Plato and On Plato First Alcibiades 1&#x2013;9 </i>(Bloomsbury, 2014).</p><p>For us, these lectures can serve as an accessible introduction to late Neoplatonism. Olympiodorus locates the <i>First Alcibiades</i> at the start of the curriculum on Plato, because it is about self-knowledge. His pupils are beginners, able to approach the hierarchy of philosophical virtues, like the aristocratic playboy Alcibiades. Alcibiades needs to know himself, at least as an individual with particular actions, before he can reach the virtues of mere civic interaction. As Olympiodorus addresses mainly Christian students, he tells them that the different words they use are often symbols of truths shared between their faiths.</p></p><p><p><b>Olympiodorus</b> (<i>c</i>. 500&#x2013;570 CE) was one of the latest non-Christian teachers of pagan philosophy in Alexandria.</p><p><b>Michael Griffin</b> is Assistant Professor of Classics and Philosophy at the University of British Columbia, Canada.</p>"[Michael Griffin] has taken on the thankless task of the translator with commendable enthusiasm, thoroughness and accuracy; the resulting volume is, like its predecessor, a labor of love ...

In this book one of the most influential political theorists of our time discusses the politics of toleration. Michael Walzer examines five "regimes of toleration"&#x2015;from multinational empires to immigrant societies&#x2015;and describes the strengths and weaknesses of each regime, as well as the varying forms of toleration and exclusion each fosters. Walzer shows how power, class, and gender interact with religion, race, and ethnicity in the different regimes and discusses how toleration works&#x2015;and how it should work&#x2015;in multicultural societies like the United States.<br><br>Walzer offers an eloquent defense of toleration, group differences, and pluralism, moving quickly from theory to practical issues, concrete examples, and hard questions. His concluding argument is focused on the contemporary United States and represents an effort to join and advance the debates about "culture war," the "politics of difference," and the "disuniting of America." Although he takes a grim view of contemporary politics, he is optimistic about the possibility of coexistence: cultural pluralism and a common citizenship can go together, he suggests, in a strong and egalitarian democracy.<br></p><p><b>Michael Walzer</b> is UPS Foundation Professor of Social Science at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. He is the coeditor of <i>Dissent</i> and a contributing editor at <i>The New Republic</i> and is the author or editor of more than a dozen books, including <i>Interpretation and Social Criticism</i>, <i>Just and Unjust Wars</i>, <i>The Company of Critics</i>, and <i>Spheres of Justice</i>.<br>Political philosopher (Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study; The Spheres of Justice, 1983, etc.) and social critic Walzer delivers elegantly turned, highly nuanced reflections on what it takes in a democratic society for different groups to live together in peace. Walzer regards toleration--making room in society for people whose beliefs and practices you don't share--as the principal work of democratic citizens. Toleration embraces a continuum of attitudes, from simple indifference to differences; resigned acceptance of them; principled recognition of the right to be different; to curiosity and even enthusiasm about human variation. Walzer identifies five historical models or regimes that encourage toleration and ultimately presents an analysis and defense of the approach that he believes works best for a multicultural US on the threshhold of the 21st century. Unlike other multiethnic models, such as multinational empires (like the USSR, which could be repressive but ruled more evenhandedly than local majorities were likely to do) or nation-states (in which one group shapes national life but tolerates members of minority groups as individual citizens), ours is an immigrant society, and Walzer explores the distinctive qualities that tend to keep the manifold parts of America's ``dispersed diversity'' cohesive, despite recent contentious assertions of various group identities in public life. Since contemporary American society is not only a pluralism of groups, but also a pluralism of individuals, there's a synergy between the pull of associational life and radical individualism that functions to knit us together. Walzer speaks of the paradoxes of power in democratic society with clarity and eloquence. He not only maintains that the US has become socially (though not economically) more egalitarian over the last 50 years, but he also confirms its capacity for further evolution, while conceding that this process may not always be harmonious. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

But these are also artworks with profound and carefully weighed formal concerns and an affiliation with the critical issues of sculpture raised throughout the twentieth century. Whiteread's work is, perhaps, provoking because it so successfully melds artistic and historical issues, restoring to public attention neglected issues that more dominant interests would wish forgotten. Out of the solidification of space Whiteread creates an archive that compacts and makes legible those intangibles that comprise so much of ordinary life. This collection of essays by leading authorities on contemporary art examines Whiteread's work from her earliest domestic objects of the late 1980s through controversial projects such as <i>House</i> to her recent, large-scale public works, including <i>Water Tower</i> in New York, <i>Monument</i> in London's Trafalgar Square, and <i>Holocaust Memorial</i> in Vienna. The book includes discussions of both <i>Room 101</i>, her cast of George Orwell's room at the BBC, and recent gallery installations. Whiteread's work is appraised both in terms of its relationship to art history and its social and political impact, and examined for theoretical approaches through which we may better understand this most complex and challenging of contemporary artists. 60 illustrations.

The author examines the phenomenon of time and asks such fascinating questions as how time impinges on people, to what extent our awareness of time is culturally conditioned, how societies deal with temporal problems and whether time can be considered a `resource&#39; to be economized. More specifically, he provides a consistent and detailed analysis of theories put forward by a number of thinkers such as Durkheim, Evans-Pritchard, L�vi-Strauss, Geertz, Piaget, Husserl and Bourdieu. His discussion encompasses four main approaches in time research, namely developmental psychology, symbolic anthropology (covering the bulk of post-Durkheimian social anthropology) `economic&#39; theories of time in social geography and, finally, phenomenological theories. The author concludes by presenting his own model of social/cognitive time, in the light of these critical discussions of the literature.</p><p>Alfred Gell formerly taught at the London School of Economics<p>&#x201c;Arguing forcefully against a number of distinguished anthropologists and his own earlier work, [Alfred Gell] has produced a critical review of the literature which is original, disturbing and sometimes brilliant...&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>MAN</i></p><p>&#x201c;Gell takes a broad sweep and his book is likely to be the standard one in this field for some time to come.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Cosmos</i></p><p>&#x201c;...

The focus of the text is on cellular telephone systems, as these systems are familiar to students; rich enough to encompass a variety of propagation issues, modulation techniques, and access schemes; and narrow enough to be treated meaningfully in a text that supports a single course. The presentation is limited to what cellular systems engineers call the "air interface" and what network engineers call the "physical layer." </p> <p> The presentation is unique in a number of ways. First, it is aimed at undergraduate students, whereas most other textbooks written about wireless systems are intended for students either at the graduate level or at the community college level. In particular, the presentation combines a clear narrative with examples showing how theoretical principles are applied in system design. The text is based on ten years' experience in teaching wireless systems to electrical and computer engineering seniors. The lessons learned from their questions and responses have guided its development. The text not only presents the basic theory but also develops a coherent, integrated view of cellular systems that will motivate the undergraduate student to stay engaged and learn more. </p> <p> Second, the text is written from a systems-engineering perspective. In this context a "system" comprises many parts, whose properties can be traded off against one another to provide the best possible service at an acceptable cost. A system with the complexity of a cellular network can be designed and implemented only by a team of component specialists whose skills complement one another. Top-level design is the responsibility of systems engineers who can translate market requirements into technical specifications, who can identify and resolve performance trade-off issues, and who can set subsystem requirements that "flow down" to the subsystem designers. The text introduces students to the concept that specialists from a wide range of engineering disciplines come together to develop a complex system. Theory and contemporary practice are developed in the context of a problem-solving discipline in which a divide-andconquer approach is used to allocate top-level functional system requirements to lower-level subsystems. Standard analysis results are developed and presented to students in a way that shows how a systems engineer can use these results as a starting point in designing an optimized system. Thus an overlying systems-engineering theme ties together a wide variety of technical principles and analytical techniques. </p> <p> This text comprises eight chapters. An introductory chapter sets out the systems-engineering story. Chapters 2 and 3 introduce the air interface by considering how to provide enough power over a wide enough area to support reliable communication. Chapter 2 introduces the free-space range equation and thermal noise. On completing this chapter, students should be aware of the dependence of received power on range and of the role of noise in determining how much power is enough for quality reception. Chapter 3 introduces the terrestrial channel and its impairments, including the effects of shadowing and multipath reception. Next, Chapter 4 introduces the principle of frequency reuse and the resulting cellular system structure. The goal of this chapter is to show how a communication system can be extended to provide service over a virtually unlimited area to a virtually unlimited number of subscribers. </p> <p> Once a power link is established, information must be encoded to propagate effectively over that link. Chapter 5 introduces modulation. The emphasis is on digital techniques common to cellular systems. Of particular interest are frequency efficiency, power efficiency and bit error rate, bandwidth, and adjacent-channel interference. Chapter 5 also introduces spread-spectrum modulation, emphasizing the ability of spread-spectrum systems to provide robust communication in the presence of narrowband interference and frequency-selective fading. On completion of Chapter 5, students will have an appreciation of the factors involved in designing a point-to-point data link between a single transmitter and a single receiver. Chapter 6 introduces methods for multiple access, including FDMA, TDMA, and an introduction to CDMA. The ability of spread-spectrum systems to support multiple users over a single channel is emphasized. </p> <p> Wireless systems carry information from a wide variety of sources, from speech to music to video to short text messages to Internet pages. When digitized, information from various sources produces data streams with differing properties. Further, subscribers apply different criteria to assessing the quality of different kinds of received information. Chapter 7 distinguishes streaming from bursty information streams. As second- and subsequent-generation cellular systems are highly dependent on effective use of speech compression, examples are given showing traditional digitization of speech and a brief introduction to linear predictive coding. Chapter 7 concludes with presentations of convolutional coding for error control and the Viterbi decoding algorithm. The systems-engineering story is pulled together in Chapter 8. </p> <p> This text has been written to support a one-term senior elective course. It is assumed that students taking the course will have completed conventional courses in signals and systems and an introduction to communication systems. The signals and systems background should include a thorough introduction to the Fourier transform. It is also assumed that readers of the text will have completed an introductory course in probability, including coverage of probability density functions, expectations, and exposure to several conventional probability distributions. The material included in this text should be more than sufficient to support a one-semester course. At Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology the book is used to support a one-quarter course that includes four instructional meetings per week for ten weeks. The course covers all of Chapter 2, selections from Chapter 3, all of Chapter 4, and most of Chapter 5. The CDMA material from Chapter 6 is included as time permits. </p></p><h2>The Finance of Higher Education: Theory, Research, Policy and Practice</h2><p>This volume is a comprehensive examination of governmental and institutional policies and practices, and of the essential theories and areas of research that in combination establish the foundation, explore and extend the boundaries, and expand the base of knowledge in the field of higher education finance.

She lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.*Starred Review* Confronted by a welter of conflicting definitions, eighteenth-century poet Alexander Pope despaired of establishing a meaning for happiness. Less easily discouraged, Bok acknowledges the contradictions in the diversity of perspectives, yet she converts these contradictions into openings for deeper inquiry. Readers will contemplate the tension between, for instance, Seneca&#x2019;s insistence on virtue as the basis for happiness and La Mettrie&#x2019;s affirmation of self-indulgence as its true fount. In a wide-ranging survey of philosophical thought, readers weigh contrasting claims about happiness proffered by the joyfully devout and the bemusedly skeptical; by the gregarious socialite and the introspective recluse; by the champions of genetic determinism and the defenders of individual agency. Merely examining such a diverse range of theories will enrich readers&#x2019; thinking. Bok, however, looks to modern research to winnow wheat from chaff. Investigations in neurophysiology, for example, have exploded long-held assumptions about how optimism generates happiness. Survey sociology has now discredited Aristotle&#x2019;s claim that advancing age means diminished happiness. Still, some knotty questions resist empirical assessment: Is true happiness the piercing exultation of a singular moment, or the gratifying culmination of an entire lifetime? What, in any case, guarantees happiness hereafter? Bok lifts her topic above merely subjective opinion into a probing intellectual analysis. --Bryce Christensen</p><h2>NEW MyLab Psychology with Pearson eText -- Valuepack Access Card</h2><p>MyPsychLab with eText.

It makes the understanding of these miracle nutrients easy to comprehend and utilize in his or her everyday life.-Earl Mindell. Author of The Herb Bible, The Vitamin Bible, and The Supplement Bible.</p><p>A pill that strengthens your heart, sharpens your mind, keeps your body young, extends your life, prevents cancer, <i>and</i> keeps your skin wrinkle-free? Sounds like a joke or a dream, doesn't it? According to molecular cell biologist Lester Packer, these pills exist--they are antioxidants. "Literally thousands of studies have confirmed that antioxidants can help prevent numerous diseases and will not only enhance life, but in all probability extend life," he writes. In <i>The Antioxidant Miracle</i>, he describes breakthroughs in antioxidant research and prescribes the Packer Plan: his "state-of-the-art antioxidant supplement, diet, and skin-care regimen." <p> According to Packer, five antioxidants "network" in our bodies with "special powers" that slow aging and fight disease: Vitamins C and E, glutathione, lipoic acid, and Coenzyme Q10. The first two are obtained through food, the others are produced by the body, but these levels decline as we age, so we need to supplement. Packer describes the benefits and actions of these special antioxidants and also recommends flavonoids such as ginkgo biloba and pycnogenol (made from the bark of pine trees), a number of carotenoids, selenium, and a variety of foods high in antioxidants. He spells out exactly what supplements you need and how much, with special modifications for smokers, diabetics, menopausal women, athletes, and people at high risk of cancer or cardiovascular disease. The book is not easy reading: lots of scientific explanations and study descriptions.</p><b>LESTER PACKER</b>, Ph.D., is regarded as the world's foremost antioxidant research scientist.

Seventeen hours later, all that remained of his bold move was a trail of destruction. Hitler was on the run from the police. His career seemed to be over.</p><p><em>The Trial of Adolf Hitler</em> tells the true story of the monumental criminal proceeding that followed when Hitler and nine other suspects were charged with high treason.

It was this trial that thrust Hitler into the limelight, provided him with an unprecedented stage for his demagoguery, and set him on his improbable path to power.</p><p>Based on trial transcripts, police files, and many other new sources, including some five hundred documents recently discovered from the Landsberg Prison record office, <em>The Trial of Adolf Hitler</em> is a gripping true story of crime and punishment&#x2015;and a haunting failure of justice with catastrophic consequences.</p> 8 pages of illustrations</p><p>David King is the New York Times best-selling author of Death in the City of Light and Vienna 1814.

Latin American artists contributed to and reinterpreted nearly every major modernist movement that took place in the creative center of Paris between World War I and World War II, including Cubism (Diego Rivera), Surrealism (Antonio Berni and Roberto Matta), and Constructivism (Joaqu�n Torres-Garc�a). Yet their participation in the Paris art scene has remained largely overlooked until now. This vibrant book examines their collective role, surveying the work of both household names and an extraordinary array of lesser-known artists.<br> &nbsp;<br> Author Michele Greet illuminates the significant ways in which Latin American expatriates helped establish modernism and, conversely, how a Parisian environment influenced the development of Latin American artistic identity. These artists, hailing from former Spanish and Portuguese colonies, encountered expectations of primitivism from their European audiences, and their diverse responses to such biased perceptions&#x2014;ranging from rejection to embrace to selective reinterpretation of European tendencies&#x2014;yielded a rich variety of formal innovation. Magnificently illustrated and conveying with clarity a nuanced portrait of modernism, <i>Transatlantic Encounters</i> also engages in a wider discussion of the relationship between displacement, identity formation, and artistic production.</p><p>The work of Latin American artists in interwar Paris receives overdue attention in this unprecedented survey, which highlights the artists&#x2019; significant role in the development of modernism.<b>Michele Greet</b> is associate professor of art history and affiliated faculty in Latin American studies and cultural studies at George Mason University.</p><h2>ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS Coding Handbook, with Answers, 2018 Rev.

The goal of this book is to clarify the role that human values play in creating practical definitions of the term biodiversity. The concept of biodiversity, according to the authors, is both more subtle and more difficult to employ in practical situations than is commonly appreciated.<br> <p>Conceptualizing and assessing biodiversity and setting conversation priorities are not narrowly defined biological problems-they are broad based human enterprises with a large social and political component. Human resources are not sufficient to protect all of biodiversity, and difficult choices of what to conserve lie ahead. The goal of this book is to clarify the role that human values play in creating practical definitions of the term biodiversity.<br> </p> <p>This book is written for conversation decision makers: conversation biologists, lawmakers, and policy planners in governmental and non-governmental agencies; business people in fields such as agriculture, forestry, and paper products; and students in al of these fields.</p></p><h2>Police in the Hallways: Discipline in an Urban High School</h2><p><p>As zero-tolerance discipline policies have been instituted at high schools across the country, police officers are employed with increasing frequency to enforce behavior codes and maintain order, primarily at poorly performing, racially segregated urban schools. Actions that may once have sent students to the detention hall or resulted in their suspension may now introduce them to the criminal justice system. In <i>Police in the Hallways</i>, Kathleen Nolan explores the impact of policing and punitive disciplinary policies on the students and their educational experience. </p><p>Through in-depth interviews with and observations of students, teachers, administrators, and police officers, Nolan offers a rich and nuanced account of daily life at a Bronx high school where police patrol the hallways and security and discipline fall under the jurisdiction of the NYPD. She documents how, as law enforcement officials initiate confrontations with students, small infractions often escalate into &#x201c;police matters&#x201d; that can lead to summonses to criminal court, arrest, and confinement in juvenile detention centers. </p><p>Nolan follows students from the classroom and the cafeteria to the detention hall, the dean&#x2019;s office, and the criminal court system, clarifying the increasingly intimate relations between the school and the criminal justice system. Placing this trend within the context of recent social and economic changes, as well as developments within criminal justice and urban school reform, she shows how this police presence has created a culture of control in which penal management overshadows educational innovation. </p><p><i>Police in the Hallways</i> also examines the prevalent forms of oppositional behavior through which students express their frustrations and their deep sense of exclusion. With compassion and clear-eyed analysis, Nolan sounds a warning about this alarming convergence of prison and school cultures and the negative impact that it has on the real lives of low-income students of color&#x2014;and, in turn, on us all. <br></p></p><p><p>Kathleen Nolan works in the Teacher Preparation Program and is a lecturer at Princeton University. She teaches seminars related to urban education. </p><p>Paul Willis is professor of sociology at Princeton University. </p><p>"<i>Police in the Hallways</i> presents a detailed ethnographic analysis of the ways in which discipline policies in New York schools have influenced the education and social experience of young people in so-called impact schools.

From Krakow and Venice to Amsterdam and Smyrna, David Ruderman examines the historical and cultural factors unique to Jewish communities throughout Europe, and how these distinctions played out amidst the rest of society. Looking at how Jewish settlements in the early modern period were linked to one another in fascinating ways, he shows how Jews were communicating with each other and were more aware of their economic, social, and religious connections than ever before.</p><br><p> Ruderman explores five crucial and powerful characteristics uniting Jewish communities: a mobility leading to enhanced contacts between Jews of differing backgrounds, traditions, and languages, as well as between Jews and non-Jews; a heightened sense of communal cohesion throughout all Jewish settlements that revealed the rising power of lay oligarchies; a knowledge explosion brought about by the printing press, the growing interest in Jewish books by Christian readers, an expanded curriculum of Jewish learning, and the entrance of Jewish elites into universities; a crisis of rabbinic authority expressed through active messianism, mystical prophecy, radical enthusiasm, and heresy; and the blurring of religious identities, impacting such groups as conversos, Sabbateans, individual converts to Christianity, and Christian Hebraists.</p><br><p> In describing an early modern Jewish culture, <i>Early Modern Jewry</i> reconstructs a distinct epoch in history and provides essential background for understanding the modern Jewish experience.</p></p><p><p>"Ruderman's scholarship is of the highest order and shows impeccable control over a huge and diverse secondary literature. He is able to convey the nature of the historical debates over the key issues in this period with clarity and integrity, and each chapter is a model of argumentation. This book will be indispensable to anyone who studies the Jewish experience."<b>--Gershon Hundert, McGill University</b></p><p>"This is an entirely original book that for the first time offers a sustained and persuasive argument for a distinct early modern period in Jewish history. Ruderman provides a synthetic account of the period based on a masterful command of the primary and secondary scholarship."<b>--David Sorkin, University of Wisconsin-Madison</b></p><b>David B.

This lyrical yet practical-minded book is at once a record of the 26 months Thoreau spent in withdrawal from society -- an account of the daily minutiae of building, planting, hunting, cooking, and, always, observing nature -- and a declaration of independence from the oppressive mores of the world he left behind. Elegant, witty, and quietly searching, Walden remains the most persuasive American argument for simplicity of life clarity of conscience.<br><br>For the first time, the authoritative editions of works by major American novelists, poets, scholars, and essayists collected in the hardcover volumes of The Library of America are being published singly in a series of handsome paperback books.

When the family moves to a bigger house with a separate room for each child, the two start arguing about whose room and windows are bigger. Mom then has them measure the windows with sheets of paper and the floor with newspaper. Ignoring her older siblings, Jill declares her room is best since it is farthest from the other two and near the cat's nook. This realistic story involves sibling rivalry with a resourceful solution to a common problem. It carefully incorporates math without being overwhelming. The colorful and humorous illustrations add to the story, which comes to a satisfying ending with a slight twist. Follow-up activities and a reading list are included.<br><i>Nancy A.

While not neglecting the lesser but still influential figures, such as Arnauld and Malebranche, John Cottingham focuses primarily on the three great "rationalists": Descartes, Spinoza, and Leibniz. He examines how they approached central problems of philosophy, and shows how closely their ideas are related, despite the radically different philosophical systems they produced. He not only places the major thinkers in their historical and philosophical contexts, but engages their ideas in a vigorously critical way, revealing their capacity to throw light on major philosophical topics that are still very much alive today.<br></p><p>The seventeenth century saw a fundamental shift in our ways of thinking about ourselves and the universe. The reassuring medieval view of an earth - centered cosmos designed expressly for the benefit of human beings had been steadily eroded; yet at the some time there emerged a new optimism about the possibility of developing a clear and comprehensive account of the working of the universe, together with a determination to penetrate the nature of the human mind and its relation to the material world.John Cottingham holds the Established Chair of Philosophy at the University of Reading.</p><h2>Classical Greek: A New Grammar: Greek grammar taught and explained, with examples.</h2><p>Like its Latin counterpart, a new grammar for both absolute beginners and students who already have a sound knowledge of the language but need to revise and enhance it. Also suitable for students of New Testament Greek. It can be used side by side with any textbook (Reading Greek, Athenaze, From Alpha to Omega, etc.) as a reference and support grammar. � ALL NECESSARY GRAMMAR: With complete explanations, removing the need for the student to consult a larger or more advanced grammar after the initial stages. � CLEAR EXPLANATIONS: Grammar explained as if hearing the teacher&#x2019;s voice from the whiteboard, with additional class-style comments included where necessary. � CLEAR STRUCTURE: Division into different blocks for the nominal system, the verbal system, syntax of cases and syntax of clauses, and internal subdivisions in each of these blocks for a completely clear presentation. � BASIC VOCABULARY: List of the most useful terms that follow a given scheme after it has been presented: nouns, adjectives, verbs, etc. � USE OF ORIGINAL AUTHORS: Combination of made-up examples, which allows the adaptation of any sentence to an easy level when necessary, and sentences taken from classical authors for more advanced students. � APPENDICES: Covering the basic rules for accentuation, the characteristics of Homeric dialect and the dual, all of them with examples. � EXERCISES IN AN ADDITIONAL BOOK (in preparation): Allowing the grammar itself to be kept to a more reasonable size and price, ideal for those who want only the grammar for consultation. � WHOLE GRAMMATICAL INDEX: All the grammatical terms relating to accidence and syntax (functions, types of verbs, kinds of subordinates, different uses of participles, etc.), alphabetically presented at the end of the book. � INDEX OF GREEK GRAMMATICAL WORDS: Lists all Greek words used in presenting and explaining grammatical functions and usage. The price of the book has been left lower than expected for a book of this size (360 pages) as it is a book aimed mainly at students.</p><p>Juan Coderch (MA, PhD) has taught Latin and Greek at the University of Oxford (Faculty of Classics, 2003-7) and since 2007 has been Senior Language Tutor in Greek and Latin at the University of St Andrews.

Critics have compared his work to such diverse artists as Kafka, Goya, Swift, Klee, and Beckett. Allen Ginsberg called Michaux genius,&#x201d; and Jorge Luis Borges wrote that Michaux&#x2019;s work is without equal in the literature of our time.&#x201d; This anthology contains substantial selections from almost all of Michaux&#x2019;s major works, most never before published in English, and allows readers to explore the haunting verbal and pictorial landscape of a twentieth-century visionary.</p><p>French painter Michaux (1899-1984) explored the subconscious mind and the effects of such hallucinogens as mescalin not only in pigment but in poetry. Here, poet Ball offers a generous and delightful selection from Michaux's published works; his translation skills bring Michaux's words to life in English, giving them the same energy and nimbleness they have in their original French. Many of the works in this anthology are prose poems, but this is essentially a collection of verse, one that requires continual reading the way a bag of peanuts requires continual eating. Observations on human interactions, as well as the life of the mind, abound. Highly recommended for most public and academic libraries; this poetry should have wide appeal. (Photos not seen.)-Francisca Goldsmith, Berkeley P.L., Cal.<br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.David Ball has assembled and translated a stunning selection of Michauxs works. . . .

Early in his career, he created abstract paintings that combined landscape influence, aerial perspective, and a deeply personal calligraphic language. Then, in late 1955, he began working in a representational mode (landscapes, figure studies, and still lifes) and was associated with the Bay Area figurative movement. Diebenkorn later abandoned figurative references in the 1960s and embarked on monumental abstract, geometrical compositions, including his celebrated <i>Ocean Park</i> works.<br><br> This four-volume catalogue raisonn� is the definitive resource on Diebenkorn&#x2019;s unique works, including his paintings, works on paper, and three-dimensional objects. The first volume gives an overview of the artist&#x2019;s career, featuring essays by noted scholars John Elderfield, Ruth E. Fine, Jane Livingston, Steven Nash, and Gerald Nordland, as well as an illustrated chronology, list of exhibitions, bibliography, and selection of studio notes. The second volume spans his student and early abstract works; the third volume features his representational works during the Berkeley period; and the fourth volume covers his later periods, as well as his sketchbooks and other little-known private drawings. Many of the more than five thousand works illustrated in this catalogue are being published for the first time, and with new color photography that showcases his work like never before.</p><p>This definitive four-volume resource on the unique work of the postwar American artist Richard Diebenkorn includes more than five thousand newly photographed works, many published for the first time.<br><b>Jane Livingston </b>is an independent curator and author. <b>Andrea Liguori</b> is managing director of the Richard Diebenkorn Foundation. &nbsp;</p><h2>Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes</h2><p>Nine years after the atom bomb was dropped in Hiroshima Japan, Sadako begins to feel sick from the radiation and dies.

Yet this is the first book to offer a coherent intellectual framework for the study of such proposals, providing the historical background necessary for a clear understanding of the current nuclear debate. Arguing that much of the patternless debate about peace proposals can be reduced to disagreements about the basic ideologies of international relations, Ceadel presents his own framework for studying the debate, examines why support for these ideologies has varied from country to country and at different points in history, and considers the special problems posed by the threat of nuclear war. Ceadel disentangles three strategic dimensions of the nuclear issue--the global balance between the U.S. and Russia, the European crisis, and Britain&#39;s stand--and analyzes the cases for and against nuclear deterrence.</p><p></p><h2>Isabella and Leonardo: The Artistic Relationship between Isabella d&#x2019;Este and Leonardo da Vinci, 1500-1506</h2><p><p>Isabella d'Este, the marchioness of Mantua, was a collector of antiquities, a patron of art, and one of the most vivid personalities of the Italian Renaissance. Her artistic relationship with Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) is charted through the letters that they exchanged over the course of about six years. Beginning in late 1499, Leonardo spent several months in Mantua, where he met Isabella and produced a finished portrait drawing of her. In the years that followed, the marchioness wrote to the artist to ask him to undertake other paintings and projects. Though little came of these requests, da Vinci did produce a drawing of some classical hard-stone vases to assist her search for collectible antiques and also started work on a painting of Christ as a twelve-year-old boy at her request.</p><p>The story of their relationship is explored in depth for the first time in <i>Isabella and Leonardo</i>. This illuminating story raises interesting and important questions about relationships between artists and patrons, and about women as art patrons at the beginning of the 16th century.</p></p><p><b>Francis Ames-Lewis</b> is emeritus professor of the history of Renaissance art at Birkbeck, University of London.</p><h2>Tin Drum, The [Hardcover] [Jan 01, 1993] Gunter Grass</h2><p>Millennium Project edition with library markings, shelf wear to dust jacket, page edges tanned. Shipped from the U.K. All orders received before 3pm sent that weekday.</p><p>Meet Oskar Matzerath, "the eternal three-year-old drummer." On the morning of his third birthday, dressed in a striped pullover and patent leather shoes, and clutching his drumsticks and his new tin drum, young Oskar makes an irrevocable decision: "It was then that I declared, resolved, and determined that I would never under any circumstances be a politician, much less a grocer; that I would stop right there, remain as I was--and so I did; for many years I not only stayed the same size but clung to the same attire." Here is a Peter Pan story with a vengeance. But instead of Never-Never Land, G�nter Grass gives us Danzig, a contested city on the Polish-German border; instead of Captain Hook and his pirates, we have the Nazis. And in place of Peter himself is Oskar, a twisted <i>puer aeternis</i> with a scream that can shatter glass and a drum rather than a shadow. First published in 1959, <i>The Tin Drum</i>'s depiction of the Nazi era created a furor in Germany, for the world of Grass's making is rife with corrupt politicians and brutal grocers in brown shirts: <blockquote> There was once a grocer who closed his store one day in November, because something was doing in town; taking his son Oskar by the hand, he boarded a Number 5 streetcar and rode to the Langasser Gate, because there as in Zoppot and Langfuhr the synagogue was on fire. The synagogue had almost burned down and the firemen were looking on, taking care that the flames should not spread to other buildings. Outside the wrecked synagogue, men in uniform and others in civilian clothes piled up books, ritual objects, and strange kinds of cloth. The mound was set on fire and the grocer took advantage of the opportunity to warm his fingers and his feelings over the public blaze. </blockquote> As Oskar grows older (though not taller), portents of war transform into the thing itself. Danzig is the first casualty when, in the summer of 1939, residents turn against each other in a pitched battle between Poles and Germans. In the years that follow, Oskar goes from one picaresque adventure to the next--he joins a troupe of traveling musicians; he becomes the leader of a group of anarchists; he falls in love; he becomes a recording artist--until some time after the war, he is convicted of murder and confined to a mental hospital. <p> <i>The Tin Drum</i> uses savage comedy and a stiff dose of magical realism to capture not only the madness of war, but also the black cancer at the heart of humanity that allows such degradations to occur. Grass wields his humor like a knife--yes, he'll make you laugh, but he'll make you bleed, as well. There have been many novels written about World War II, but only a handful can truly be called great; <i>The Tin Drum</i>, without a doubt, is one. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>The greatest German novel since the end of World War II, <b>The Tin Drum</b> is the autobiography of Oskar Matzerath, thirty years old, detained in a mental hospital, convicted of a murder he did not commit.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the day of his third birthday, Oskar had "declared, resolved, and determined [to] stop right there, remain as I was, stay the same size, cling to the same attire" (striped pullover and patent-leather shoes).&nbsp;&nbsp;That same day Oskar receives his first tin drum, and from then on it is the means of his expression, allowing him to draw forth memories from the past as well as judgments about the horrors, injustices, and eccentricities he observes through the long nightmare of the Nazi era.&nbsp;&nbsp;As that era ebbs bloodily away, as drum succeeds drum, Oskar participates in the German postwar economic miracle -- working variously in the black market, as an artist's model, in a troupe of traveling musicians.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the onset of affluence and fame, Oskar decides to grow a few inches, only to develop a humpback.&nbsp;&nbsp;But despite his newfound status (and stature), Oskar remains haunted by the deaths of his parents, afflicted by his responsibility for past sins -- and so assumes guilt for a murder he did not commit as an act of atonement and an opportunity to find consolation.The rhythms of Oskar's drums are intricate and insistent, and they lead us, often by way of shocking fantasies, through the dark forest of German history.&nbsp;&nbsp;Through Oskar's piercing, outspoken voice and deformed little figure, through the imaginative distortion and exaggeration of historical experience, a pathetically hilarious yet startlingly true portrayal of the human situation comes into view.</p><h2>Uneasy Alchemy: Citizens and Experts in Louisiana&#39;s Chemical Corridor Disputes (Urban and Industrial Environments)</h2><p><p>Louisiana annually reports over eight tons of toxic waste for each citizen. Uneasy Alchemy examines the role of experts&#x2015;lawyers, economists, health professionals, and scientists&#x2015;in the struggles for environmental justice in the state's infamous Chemical Corridor or "Cancer Alley." This legendary toxic zone between New Orleans and Baton Rouge is home to about 125 oil and chemical plants; cancer and respiratory illness rates there are among the highest in the nation. The efforts of residents to ensure a healthy environment is one of the most important social justice movements of the post-civil rights era. Louisiana is an especially appropriate venue for the examination of race, class, and politics within an environmental justice framework because of the critical role the chemical industry has played in the economic development of the state, and the weak record of state agencies in controlling toxic chemicals and enforcing environmental regulations. But while Louisiana suffers from some of the worst chemical pollution in the nation, it has also been the site of important environmental victories. Using ethnographic analysis of interviews with citizens, activists, and experts, media accounts, policy reports, government documents, minutes of hearings, and company statements, Barbara Allen identifies the factors that contribute to successful environmental justice efforts. She finds that the most successful strategies involved temporary alliances between local citizens and expert-activists, across lines of race and class, and between local and national organizations. These alliances were not easy to achieve&#x2015;local citizens tend to mistrust outside experts and want fast action in response to health threats&#x2015;but once formed, these powerful combinations of local and expert knowledge were an important force for action and change.</p></p><p>Barbara L.

The work contains a 40-page history of Masonry: from Adam to the reign of King George I, including, among others, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Solomon, Hiram Abif, Nebuchadnezzar, Augustus Caesar, Vitruvius, King Athelstan the Saxon, Inigo Jones, and James I of England. It is a celebration of the science of Geometry and the Royal Art of Architecture.

Each system is then evaluated from the perspective of three widely recognized values: promoting human well-being, giving people what they deserve, and promoting human liberty. Though the book defends a particular position, it is also written to encourage readers to think about the issues intelligently and form their own educated views on the subject. Written in a clear and readable style, <i>Economic Justice</i> explains the central ideas on the nature of capitalism, socialism, and the welfare state while providing concise discussions of the major theorists: Marx, Nozick, and Rawls. <b> </b> An important and valuable book for any reader interested in understanding and evaluating the current debates and issues of economic justice as they relate to capitalism and the welfare state. </p></p><p></p><h2>Brazil: The Troubled Rise of a Global Power</h2><p>Title: Brazil( The Troubled Rise of a Global Power) Binding: Hardcover Author: MichaelReid Publisher: YaleUniversityPress</p><p><b>Michael Reid </b>is <i>The Economist</i>&#x2019;s Latin American columnist.

Landow was one of the first scholars to explore the implications of giving readers instant, easy access to a virtual library of sources as well as unprecedented control of what and how they read.

Its primary audience, though, is made up of artists, conservators, museum professionals, and art dealers. The book is divided into sections that deal separately with the main elements of a painting: wooden supports, ground layer, paint layer, and varnish. Materials are discussed, as are the causes of damage and the subsequent restoration techniques employed. A final chapter deals with the importance of documentation in conservation work, offering tips on written, graphic, videotaped, and photographic record-keeping with guidelines on how to photograph the art throughout the restoration process. The book is very technical and is geared to readers with some knowledge of the subject; not all of the esoteric terms are included in the glossary. Nonetheless, this is still a very useful study for major art collections.AMargarete Gross, Chicago P.L. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Headless Horseman (Step-Into-Reading, Step 3)</h2><p>Illus. in full color.

Commanding more than a million men as a General, and then Field Marshal, in the Imperial German Army, he held off the attacks of the British Expeditionary Force under Sir John French and then Sir Douglas Haig for four long years. But Rupprecht was to lose not only the war, but his son and his throne. <br><br>In <em>Haig's Enemy</em>, Jonathan Boff explores the tragic tale of Rupprecht's war--the story of a man caught under the wheels of modern industrial warfare. Providing a fresh viewpoint on the history of the Western Front, Boff draws on extensive research in the German archives to offer a history of the First World War from the other side of the barbed wire. He revises conventional explanations of why the Germans lost with an in-depth analysis of the nature of command, and of the institutional development of the British, French, and German armies as modern warfare was born. Using Rupprecht's own diaries and letters, many of them never before published, <em>Haig's Enemy</em> views the Great War through the eyes of one of Germany's leading generals, shedding new light on many of the controversies of the Western Front. <br><br>The picture which emerges is far removed from the sterile stalemate of myth. Instead, Boff re-draws the Western Front as a highly dynamic battlespace, both physical and intellectual, where three armies struggled not only to out-fight, but also to out-think, their enemy. The consequences of falling behind in the race to adapt would be more terrible than ever imagined.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jonathan Boff</strong> is a Senior Lecturer in History and War Studies at the University of Birmingham, where he teaches courses on conflict from Homer to Helmand. He specializes in the First World War and his previous book, <em>Winning and Losing on the Western Front: The British Third Army and the Defeat of</em> <em>Germany in 1918 </em>(CUP, 2012) was short-listed for the Templer Medal and for the British Army Book of the Year award. He was educated at Merton College, Oxford and the Department of War Studies, King's College London and spent twenty years working in finance before returning to academia. He serves on the councils of the National Army Museum and Army Records Society, has worked as a historical consultant with the British Army and the BBC, and is a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society.<br><br>"Boff has produced a welcome study, which will interest many students of military history. He has introduced a leading German figure of the First World War to an anglo-phone audience, and he has offered a persuasive historical analysis of critical issues of staff and command." -- Roger Chickering, <em>Journal of Modern History</em><p></p><br>"Boff's book provides an important contribution to our understanding of the First World War. It is well written, and the scholarship is excellent."-- <em>History: Reviews of New Books</em><p></p><br>"More than simply a biography, <em>Haig's Enemy</em> is a fresh, engaging, and thought-provoking book that should appeal to both academics and casual readers alike. Above all, it reminds the reader that the war of 1914-18 was a truly international event and that there are always two sides to every story. In this respect, Boff's findings make an important and very welcome contribution to the ongoing academic debate concerning military learning and adaptation during the First World War." -- <em>War in History</em><p></p><br>"Of all diaries and memoirs written by the senior German officers of the First World War, that of Crown Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria has long been regarded as the most revealing. Yet Rupprecht himself has remained elusive, his contribution eclipsed by his more voluble and histrionic contemporaries. Jonathan Boff has not only brought him to life (and to an English audience), but done so in a book that ranges far more widely than a conventional biography. Readers will gain fresh perspectives on the British and French as much as they learn about Rupprecht's Bavarians."--Sir Hew Strachan, University of St Andrews and editor of Oxford's Great Battles series<p></p><br>"<em>Haig's Enemy</em> is a very welcome addition to the literature. As the title suggests, Crown Prince Rupprecht was one of the most significant German commanders to face the British Army across No Man's Land, but until now we have lacked a biography in English. What is more, Jonathan Boff has pulled off the rare trick of writing a book that is both scholarly and very readable--it is a triumph."--Gary Sheffield, Professor of War Studies, University of Wolverhampton<p></p><br>"This scholarly but lucid and beautifully written account of the German High Command is essential reading for anyone who wishes to understand how the fighting on the Western Front developed during the First World War."--Professor Sir Michael Howard<p></p><br>"Boff has produced a welcome study, which will interest many students of military history. He has introduced a leading German figure of the First World War to an anglophone audience, and he has offered a persuasive historical analysis of critical issues of staff and command." --<em>Journal of Modern</em> <em>History</em><p></p><br>"The literature on the First World War has grown enormously over the past three decades, given a further recent boost by the centenary of the war. It thus comes as a surprise to realize that, apart from Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff, no senior German commander has yet been the subject of a full English-language biography, though several memoirs appeared in English soon after the war. Historian Jonathan Boff (Univ. of Birmingham) has thus begun to fill a serious gap in the scholarship on World War I. <em>Haig's Enemy</em> centers specifically on Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria, who, for much of the war, commanded the main German forces opposing the British on the Western Front." -- <em>Michigan War Studies Review</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Business Ethics</h2><p>There is NO access code, JUST the loose-leaf version of text</p><p>The author and editor of numerous books and articles in the areas of ethics and social and political philosophy, William H.

Yet it remains little known outside Russia. Attempts to render Pushkin&#39;s Russian stanzas into verse have tried in vain to imitate the most inimitable features of the original, while masking many of its other glories. This prose version, for the first time, gives us a Eugene Onegin that is easy and enjoyable to read. Where previous versions lost the novel in the verse, Roger Clarke has discarded the verse to bring us the novel. And more than the novel: what shines through here are not only Puskin&#39;s touching story and subtle characterisation, but his incisive pictures of contemporary Russian life and landscapes, his social and literary comment, his humour, and indeed the essential poetry of the work. The addition of four captivating verse-tales from Pushkin&#39;s early maturity makes this book a must for anybody interested in Russian or European literature.</p><p><p><b>James E.

He&#39;s set the world a good example, which others would do well to sample, but it&#39;s a bore, when night and day the sick man forces you to stay! To keep him sweet, as if he&#39;s dying, give him his daily medicine and make quite sure that it goes in, adjust the pillows while one&#39;s sighing: &#39;Don&#39;t even think of getting well, The devil take you, go to hell!&#39; 2) Thus thought a ne&#39;erdowell and dandy whom Zeus had made his uncle&#39;s heir: to him the money&#39;d come in handy, so coach and horses rushed him there. For those who love my comic thriller of Ruslan and his dear Ludmilla, I&#39;ll introduce without ado, the hero of my tale to you: Onegin, whom I&#39;ve long befriended, had grown up on the Neva&#39;s shore, perhaps like you, dear reader, for St. Petersburg is truly splendid where once we wandered back and forth, though now I really hate the North. Chapter Five 1) That year the warm and autumn weather appeared to wish that it could stay, and nature dawdled, altogether reluctant ever to make way for winter; suddenly some flurries of shining snow arrived and hurried to cover fences, houses, lanes, drew patterns on the window panes. Tatiana wakes and sees the whitened and gleaming countryside; the trees in wintry silver, magpies please her eyes, the hills around now lighten as swirling snowflakes gently float, enclosing all in winter&#39;s coat. 2) So now it&#39;s wintertime! The peasant sets off, rejoicing in the day, his horse, in snow both crisp and pleasant, is snorting as it drags the sleigh, while fleet kibitkas glide for hours and throw up fluffy, snowy showers; the coachman drives with proud panache in sheepskin coat and crimson sash; a country urchin blithely scampers along and pulls his little sled on which a mongrel sits, instead of him; he laughs at frozen fingers, inflamed in all the biting cold, not caring as his mother scolds.</p><h2>Speaking Better French: The Key Words and Expressions You&#39;ll Need Every Day</h2><p>This book will help you use the little key words and expressions that you&#39;ll need every day in French conversation. They are the French equivalents of English expressions like: &#34;just in case&#34;, &#34;as soon as&#34;, &#34;in spite of&#34;, &#34;provided that&#34;, and many others. You might use an idiom like &#34;sowing his wild oats&#34; once in ten years, but you hear and use expressions like &#34;just in case&#34; and &#34;as soon as&#34; all the time. You need to know them! They make the language flow. In addition you&#39;ll learn how to use the most common everyday expressions from colloquial spoken French, like &#34;Pas de probl�me&#34;, &#34;Quelle horreur&#34;, &#34;J&#39;en ai marre&#34;, and &#34;Ne te casse pas la t�te.&#34; The key words and expressions are individually discussed and illustrated in phrases and sentences, each with a discussion of context so that you will become more comfortable with them. Not only will you recognize these expressions and key words if you hear or read them, but you will be able to use them yourself. This book will be a pleasure for you.

This enlightening book fills the gap. Philip Kitcher constructs an original and persuasive secular perspective, one that answers human needs, recognizes the objectivity of values, and provides for the universal desire for meaningfulness.<br> &nbsp;<br> Kitcher thoughtfully and sensitively considers how secularism can respond to the worries and challenges that all people confront, including the issue of mortality. He investigates how secular lives compare with those of people who adopt religious doctrines as literal truth, as well as those who embrace less literalistic versions of religion. Whereas religious belief has been important in past times, Kitcher concludes that evolution away from religion is now essential. He envisions the successors to religious life, where the senses of identity and community traditionally fostered by religion will instead draw on a broader range of cultural items&#x2014;those provided by poets, filmmakers, musicians, artists, scientists, and others. With clarity and deep insight, Kitcher reveals the power of secular humanism to encourage fulfilling human lives built on ethical truth.</p><p><b>Philip Kitcher</b> is John Dewey Professor of Philosophy, Columbia University.

He is the author of many books, including most recently <i>Deaths in Venice</i>.&#x201c;This is the most philosophically sophisticated and rigorous defense of atheism in the contemporary literature.&nbsp;<i>Life After Faith</i>&nbsp;provides an informed and responsible statement of the secular humanist viewpoint.&#x201d;&#x2015;Gary Gutting, University of Notre Dame (Gary Gutting 2014-03-15)<br><br>&#x201c;A brilliant and complete little book. . . tremendously impressive and illuminating.&#x201d;&#x2015;James Wood, Harvard University (James Wood 2014-04-15)<br><br>&#x201c;This book is a deeper and more convincing critique of traditional religious belief than anything written by the New Atheists. Kitcher deals conscientiously with every objection to secular humanism and shows why each one fails.&#x201d;&#x2014;David A. Hollinger, author of <i>After Cloven Tongues of Fire</i> (David Hollinger 2014-05-08)<br><br>&#x201c;Philip Kitcher has composed&nbsp;the most&nbsp;formidable defense of&nbsp;the secular view of life since Dewey. Unlike almost all of contemporary atheism,&nbsp;<i>Life After Faith</i> is utterly devoid of cartoons and caricatures of religion.&nbsp;It is, instead, a sober and soulful book, an exemplary&nbsp;practice&nbsp;of philosophical reflection.&nbsp;Scrupulous in its argument, elegant in its style,&nbsp;humane in its spirit,&nbsp;it is animated by&nbsp;a stirring&nbsp;aspiration to&nbsp;wisdom. Even as I quarrel with it I admire it.&#x201d;&#x2014;Leon Wieseltier (Leon Wieseltier 2014-06-02)<br><br>&#x201c;Philip Kitcher takes seriously the challenge of showing how, without a belief in the transcendent, we can still live lives that are rich with meaning, because they are thoroughly committed to the pursuit of what is good and beautiful and true.&#x201d;&#x2014;Kwame Anthony Appiah, author of <i>The Honor Code</i> (Kwame Anthony Appiah 2014-06-05)<br><br>&#x201c;[An] elegant book . . . a persuasive case that a secular outlook on life can produce value, meaning, and solace . . . Kitcher's real strength is his sensitivity to human suffering and mortality, and the ways in which those concerns must be addressed.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i> (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;A work of major erudition, clarity, and stimulating arguments . . . a welcome contribution to the current god debate.

Sensible, restrained Elinor seems to have found a kindred spirit in Edward Ferrars, while the impetuous, romantic Marianne falls hard for the dashing Willoughby. But each man has a secret that may destroy the relationship. Will the sisters find happiness--or betrayal?<br></p><p>Though not the first novel she wrote, <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> was the first Jane Austen published. Though she initially called it <i>Elinor and Marianne</i>, Austen jettisoned both the title and the epistolary mode in which it was originally written, but kept the essential theme: the necessity of finding a workable middle ground between passion and reason. The story revolves around the Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne. Whereas the former is a sensible, rational creature, her younger sister is wildly romantic--a characteristic that offers Austen plenty of scope for both satire and compassion. Commenting on Edward Ferrars, a potential suitor for Elinor's hand, Marianne admits that while she "loves him tenderly," she finds him disappointing as a possible lover for her sister: <blockquote> Oh! Mama, how spiritless, how tame was Edward's manner in reading to us last night! I felt for my sister most severely. Yet she bore it with so much composure, she seemed scarcely to notice it. I could hardly keep my seat. To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild, pronounced with such impenetrable calmness, such dreadful indifference! </blockquote> Soon however, Marianne meets a man who measures up to her ideal: Mr. Willoughby, a new neighbor. So swept away by passion is Marianne that her behavior begins to border on the scandalous. Then Willoughby abandons her; meanwhile, Elinor's growing affection for Edward suffers a check when he admits he is secretly engaged to a childhood sweetheart. How each of the sisters reacts to their romantic misfortunes, and the lessons they draw before coming finally to the requisite happy ending forms the heart of the novel. Though Marianne's disregard for social conventions and willingness to consider the world well-lost for love may appeal to modern readers, it is Elinor whom Austen herself most evidently admired; a truly happy marriage, she shows us, exists only where sense and sensibility meet and mix in proper measure. <i>--Alix Wilber</i>Jane Austen&#39;s first published novel introduced many of the themes which would dominate Austen&#39;s future work. Austen writes about everyday events of her own time with a subtlety and sensitivity unprecedented in the English novel.

Now, against the wishes of the Native inhabitants, the government of British Columbia has opened the Sacred Headwaters to industrial development.

Wade and Brown v. Board of Education. A Texas company was recently allowed to calm a patent on basmati rice, a kind of rice grown in India for hundreds of years. The Mining Act of 1872 is still in effect, allowing companies to buy land from the government at USD5 and acre if they pan to mine it. These are resources that belong to al of use, yet they are being given away to companies with anything but the common interest in mind. Where was the public outcry, or the government intervention, when these were happening? The answers are alarming. Private corporations are consuming the resources that the American people collectively own at a staggering rate, and the government is not protecting the commons on our behalf. In Silent Theft , David Bollier exposes the audacious attempts of companies to appropriate medical breakthroughs, public airwaves, outer space, state research, and even the DNA of plants and animals. Amazingly, these abuses often go unnoticed, Bollier argues, because we have lost our ability to see the commons. Publicly funded technological innovations create common wealth (cell phone airwaves, internet addresses, gene sequences) at blinding speed, while an economic atmosphere of deregulation and privatization ensures they will be quickly bought and sold. In an age of market triumphalism, does the notion of the commons have any practical meaning? Crisp and revelatory, Silent Theft is a bold attempt to develop a new language of the commons, a new ethos of commonwealth in the face of a market ethic that knows no bounds.</p><p>"The subject of Silent Theft is urgently important, and Bollier's handling of this complex set of issues is both deft and straightforward. The more people who read Silent Theft, the better our world."--Norman Lear <p>"This beautifully written, carefully argued book shows how little we learned from the past. Free and open resources have always been central to creativity and growth; Bollier shows how in a range of important contexts, free and open resources are being enclosed, to the benefit of the corporate class, and burden of Americans generally." --Lawrence Lessig, Stanford Law School, and author of The Future of Ideas: The Fate of the Commons in a Connected World </p><p>"A calm reasonable primer on a topic of enormous importance. Buy a copy, and when you've read it, donate it to that wonderful commons called your local library."--Bill McKibben author, The End of Nature</p><strong>David Bollier</strong> has worked for twenty years as a journalist, activist, and public policy analyst.

Asserting that patterns of social and asocial behavior are strategies for coping with issues of attachment, the authors demonstrate the unique merits of adult attachment theory both as a means for investigating social behavior and as a construct to guide clinical practice. Describing the characteristics and role of attachment in the adult years, the volume offers authoritative exposition of the essential concepts of attachment theory and presents thoughtful and creative proposals for its further development. As such, this illuminating work represents an important first step toward the classification of adult attachment theory as a field of study in its own right. <br><br>The book first defines reciprocal attachment relationships for adults using criteria that are congruent with the definition for infants and children. Detailed case studies illustrate the clinical relevance of attachment as an organizational construct, and principles currently used to explain biological development are applied to the study of personality development. Discussing the view that models of attachment always have affective content, the authors explain that these models are centered around a pattern of feelings that can be observed throughout the individual's life. <br><br>In an insightful examination of insecure attachment, the book shows how these feelings are inevitably associated with the feared loss of security invested in the attachment relationship, then explores defensive processes from an attachment perspective. The authors describe their methodologies for assessing both the underlying dimensions of adult reciprocal attachment and the primary patterns of insecure attachment. They discuss the contribution of patterns of insecure attachment to the differential diagnosis of a subset of personality disorders. Demonstrating how attachment theory can be used to guide psychotherapy, the book also points out that attachment theory can be useful in indicating when psychotherapy has been effective. Finally, important distinctions are drawn between adult reciprocal attachment and other interpersonal constructs such as dependency, romantic love, and social support.<br><br>An ideal introduction to adult attachment theory, this volume provides a powerful tool for both social research and therapeutic intervention. As such, it will be welcomed by researchers, clinicians, and students interested in the ways adult relationships affect mental health. <br></p><p>Malcolm L. West, Ph.D., is Associate Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Calgary.<br> Adrienne E. Sheldon-Keller, Ph.D., is Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Virginia."This is a first rate addition to the rapidly growing literature on attachment in adult life. The authors anchor their concept of reciprocal attachment firmly in established theory then move it boldly forward with solid empirical and clinical investigations. Well referenced and highly readable." --K.S. Adam, M.D., McMaster University<br><br>"Adult attachment has become one of the more important areas of research and theory in psychology.

These events have fuelled intense discussions in scientific conferences, government agencies, cafes, and on street corners around the world. Why are these events happening? Is this the emerging signal of climate change, and should we expect more of this? Media reports vary widely, but one mysterious agent has risen to prominence in many cases: the jet stream.<br><br>The story begins on a windswept beach in Barbados, from where we follow the ascent of a weather balloon that will travel along the jet stream all around the world. From this viewpoint we observe the effect of the jet in influencing human life around the hemisphere, and witness startling changes emerging. What is the jet stream and how well do we understand it? How does it affect our weather and is it changing? These are the main questions tackled in this book. We learn about how our view of the wind has developed from Aristotle's early theories up to today's understanding. We see that the jet is intimately connected with dramatic contrasts between climate zones and has played a key historical role in determining patterns of trade. We learn about the basic physics underlying the jet and how this knowledge is incorporated into computer models which predict both tomorrow's weather and the climate of future decades. And finally, we discuss how climate change is expected to affect the jet, and introduce the vital scientific debate over whether these changes have contributed to recent extreme weather events.<br></p><p><br>Tim Woollings, <em>Associate Professor, Department of Physics, University of Oxford</em><br><br>Tim Woollings obtained his PhD in Meteorology in 2005 and since then has worked on a variety of topics spanning weather prediction, atmospheric dynamics and circulation, and the effects of climate change.

But over the past four years, Mike Rose has been visiting classrooms across the country - from blue-collar Los Angeles to Mexican-American border towns; from the south side of Chicago to rural Montana; from Mississippi and Kentucky to Baltimore and New York City - and has been struck again and again by their intellectual and social richness and by what they suggest about the current state of education. Rose&#39;s previous book, Lives on the Boundary, was an award-winning investigation of the way America views its large numbers of adults and children who have been labeled remedial, underprepared, or illiterate. In Possible Lives Rose provides a provocative opportunity to revitalize our hopes for public education by taking us into classrooms. He watches teachers work and listens as students reason through problems. With compassion, insight, and</p><p>Mike Rose is on the faculty of the UCLA Graduate School of Education and Information Studies and UCLA Writing Programs.Rose (Lives on the Boundary) spent four years crisscrossing the U.S. to sit in on public school classrooms in New York, Baltimore, Chicago and Los Angeles, from the Mississippi Delta to Kentucky's coal district to the bicultural California city of Calexico on the Mexican border. In a hopeful journey through America's public school system, he emphasizes examples of inspired teaching, insight and connection, achievement against odds. The effective teachers whom he profiles through interviews, oral testimonies and reportage evinced solidarity with students' backgrounds, maintained high expectations and let students shape the direction of discussion; their classes demanded thought, participation, effort. Rose, who directs the UCLA writing program, sets these portraits of dynamic classrooms in the context of school-policy battles, community action and a legacy of systematic underfunding. Condemning the "strange mix of apocalyptic vignettes" that passes for public discussion about the state of American education, he offers a constructive and inspirational resource for anyone concerned about the health of public education. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Child&#39;s Garden of Verses: A Pop-Up Book</h2><p>A richly detailed pop-up picture book adds new excitement and enchantment to twelve of Stevenson&#39;s most famous poems for children, including &#34;The Wind,&#34; &#34;The Swing,&#34; &#34;Rain,&#34; and &#34;The Land of Counterpane.&#34;</p><p><blockquote><i> "The world is so full of a number of things, I'm sure we should all be as happy as kings."</i> </blockquote><p> With this "Happy Thought," Robert Louis Stevenson speaks for all the delights of childhood. But he doesn't stop there. <i>A Child's Garden of Verses</i>, written over a century ago, is filled to the brim with what are usually considered to be the first real poems written for children. This classic volume is an old friend to the generations of readers who were brought up on "I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me/ And what can be the use of him is more than I can see." In this perfectly lovely edition, the gossamer art of Jessie Willcox Smith (who first illustrated Stevenson's poems in the early years of the 20th century) is reproduced in all its charming glory. Black and white drawings throughout and eight full-page, warmly colorful paintings show beautiful, yet pleasantly imperfect children, busy at their daily activities--climbing trees, watching their reflections in a river, or sick in bed with an army of toy soldiers on guard. Place this on the shelf next to Mother Goose, Dr. Seuss, and Peter Rabbit. (All ages) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>First published in 1885, Stevenson&#39;s verses so truly reflect the feelings of young children--about being small, the bliss of going up in a swing so high, discovering one&#39;s shadow, happiness and sorrow and dreaming--that they have never ceased to be an essential part of a child&#39;s library. Robinson&#39;s beautiful pictures originally appeared in 1896 in the first illustrated edition.</p><h2>Painting With Light</h2><p>Few cinematographers have had as decisive an impact on the cinematic medium as John Alton. Best known for his highly stylized film noir classics <i>T-Men, He Walked by Night</i>, and <i>The Big Combo</i>, Alton earned a reputation during the 1940s and 1950s as one of Hollywood's consummate craftsmen through his visual signature of crisp shadows and sculpted beams of light. No less renowned for his virtuoso color cinematography and deft appropriation of widescreen and Technicolor, he earned an Academy Award in 1951 for his work on the musical <i>An American in Paris.</i> First published in 1949, <i>Painting With Light </i>remains one of the few truly canonical statements on the art of motion picture photography, an unrivaled historical document on the workings of postwar American cinema. In simple, non-technical language, Alton explains the job of the cinematographer and explores how lighting, camera techniques, and choice of locations determine the visual mood of film. Todd McCarthy's introduction provides an overview of Alton's biography and career and explores the influence of his work on contemporary cinematography and the foreword, written expressly for this edition by award-winning cinematographer John Bailey, explores Alton&#x2019;s often contentious relationships with colleagues, the American Society of Cinematographers, and the movie industry itself.</p><p><i>Painting With Light</i> was the first book on cinematography written by a major Hollywood cameraman. Published in 1949 and now put back into print, it is one of the best and most unusual books in the field. Written with good humor and full of helpful diagrams and photographs, it is certainly the most entertaining. Its technological discussions are dated, but <i>Painting With Light</i> remains relevant because its primary focus is on light itself and the many complex ways the camera crew can manipulate it. This new edition contains a biographical introduction by Todd McCarthy, who describes how the man who shot the strikingly colorful ballet sequence in <i>An American in Paris</i> also helped define the stark, haunting style of the <i>film noir</i>."A wonderful introduction to the workings of the Hollywood system. We learn in rich and yet accessible detail about special effects, technical wizardry and gadgetry, lighting, make-up, the breakdown of crews, and filming strategies.

Consisting of twelve original essays, it sets forth the issues that specialists and laymen alike must keep in mind as they try to understand the nature and significance of this complex problem. Unlike most histories of the German resistance, this volume does not restrict its focus to well-known opposition factions such as the Kreisau Circle and the Twentieth of July conspiracy; rather, it includes investigations of resistance efforts by Jews, women, workers, and young people. The Socialist opposition is illuminated by the personal observations of former West German chancellor, Willy Brandt.</p><p>Unlike most histories of the German resistance, this volume is not restricted to well-known opposition factions such as the Kreisau Circle and the Twentieth of July conspiracy.

His English publisher had excised many of the Scottish words and phrases he had used to evoke the suspense of the novel. From simple misreadings to deliberate revisions, subsequent printed editions represented major departures from Stevenson's handwritten text.<br><br>Drawing on the unique autograph manuscript in the Huntington Library, Professor Barry Menikoff has faithfully reproduced the text as Stevenson originally wrote it, restoring the author's language and punctuation, as well as the authentic Scots quality of his diction.<br><br>This handsome new edition of a novel, whose avowed purpose was the recovery of an important part of Scots history, reproduces for the first time the original drawings that accompanied the text during its serialization in <i>Young Folks</i>. Menikoff's substantial introduction situates the book in its cultural context and enables us to see why Stevenson's contemporaries were both entranced and awed by his achievement. In his extensive notes to the novel, he reveals Stevenson's enormous prestige as an authority on language, both English and Scots, for <i>Kidnapped</i> was widely drawn upon as a reference by lexicographers for the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> and the <i>Scottish National Dictionary</i>. Finally, for a tale that charts the "wanderings" of David Balfour over the land and seas of Scotland, this edition is the first to provide a gazetteer of place-names encountered during the course of those travels.</p><p>For the better part of a century &#34;Kidnapped&#34; has occupied an ambiguous position in literary and cultural studies. Its initial appearance in a weekly magazine called &#34;Young Folks Paper,&#34; along with Stevenson&#39;s disingenuous comment that the novel had a diverting rather than a serious aim, have in effect trapped the book in the never-neverland of children&#39;s literature. Yet it is universally acknowledges as a classic of world literature and the novelist always considered it his finest achievement -- taken together with its sequel, &#34;David Balfour,&#34; the best he was capable of in fiction. Now, for the first readers can plainly see why Stevenson placed his story of David Balfour on so high a pedestal. Drawing on the unique autograph manuscript in California&#39;s Huntington Library, Professor Barry Menikoff faithfully reproduces the text as Stevenson originally wrote it, restoring the punctuation (of which the novelist was a master) and recovering the distinctive and often singular language that had been altered or deleted. The effect is to deepen and illuminate the Scottish texture of the novel. For a book so embedded in Scottish history as &#34;Kidnapped,&#34; so revelatory of its fierce loyalties and violent enmities, the discovery that Stevenson was even more nationalistic than we had known comes at an opportune moment, with the opening of the new Scottish parliament. This handsome new edition of a novel whose avowed purpose was the recovery of an important part of Scots history reproduces for the first time the original drawings that accompanied the text during its serialization in &#34;Young Folks.&#34; Professor Menikoff&#39;s substantial introduction situates the book in its cultural context, and enables us to see why Stevenson&#39;s contemporaries were both entranced and awed by his achievement. And in his extensive notes to the novel he reveals Stevenson&#39;s enormous prestige as an authority on language, both English and Scots, for &#34;Kidnapped&#34; was widely drawn upon as a reference by lexicographers for the &#34;Oxford English Dictionary&#34; and the &#34;Scottish National Dictionary.&#34; Finally, for a tale that charts the &#34;wanderings&#34; of David Balfour over the land and seas of Scotland, this edition is the first to provide a gazetteer of place-names encountered during the course of those travels.<b>Barry Menikoff</b> is professor of English and American literature at the University of Hawaii and one of the world's leading authorities on Robert Louis Stevenson.

Her fascinating story is one defined by gender, class, technology, and changing patterns of production. </p><p>Alcohol was essential to colonial life; the region&#x2019;s water was foul, milk was generally unavailable, and tea and coffee were far too expensive for all but the very wealthy. Colonists used alcohol to drink, in cooking, as a cleaning agent, in beauty products, and as medicine. Meacham finds that the distillation and brewing of alcohol for these purposes traditionally fell to women. Advice and recipes in such guidebooks as The Accomplisht Ladys Delight demonstrate that women were the main producers of alcohol until the middle of the 18th century. Men, mostly small planters, then supplanted women, using new and cheaper technologies to make the region&#x2019;s cider, ale, and whiskey. </p><p>Meacham compares alcohol production in the Chesapeake with that in New England, the middle colonies, and Europe, finding the Chesapeake to be far more isolated than even the other American colonies. She explains how home brewers used new technologies, such as small alembic stills and inexpensive cider pressing machines, in their alcoholic enterprises. She links the importation of coffee and tea in America to the temperance movement, showing how the wealthy became concerned with alcohol consumption only after they found something less inebriating to drink. </p><p>Taking a few pages from contemporary guidebooks, <i>Every Home a Distillery</i> includes samples of historic recipes and instructions on how to make alcoholic beverages. American historians will find this study both enlightening and surprising.</p></p><p><p>In this fresh study of alcohol production in early America, Sarah Hand Meacham explores the crucial role women played in cidering, brewing, and distilling in the colonial Chesapeake.

Audi argues that citizens in a free democracy should distinguish religious and secular considerations and give them separate though related roles. Wolterstorff argues that religious elements are both appropriate in politics and indispensable to the vitality of a pluralistic democracy. Each philosopher first states his position in detail, then responds to and criticizes the opposing viewpoint. Written with engaging clarity, Religion in the Public Square will spur discussion among scholars, students, and citizens.</p><p>Robert Audi is Charles J. Mach Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at the University of Nebraska, the author of numerous books and articles, and the editor of The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy. Nicholas Wolterstorff is Noah Porter Professor of Philosophical Theology at Yale University and the author of, among other books, Divine Discourse and John Locke and the Ethics of Belief.An extremely valuable contribution on the place of religious ideas in our country's political life. . . . Clearly written and accessible . . . this book will greatly enrich both those seeking an introduction to the place of religious conviction in political life and those who have already engaged that troubling subject. (Kent Greenwalt, Columbia University Law School <i>The Philosophical Review</i>)<br><br>Robert Audi and Nicholas Wolterstorff are two of the most thoughtful voices in the contemporary debate about the proper role of religion in politics. Their book, <i>Religion In The Public Square</i>, makes an important contribution. I recommend it highly. (Michael J. Perry, Northwestern University)<br><br>The book presents two sides to the question of the role of religion in the public square. Both positions are well argued, informed and clearly presented. While the book's clarity makes it an excellent source for an undergraduate course, it does such a good job of bringing out key issues that it stands as a contribution to an understanding of the foundations of liberal democracy valuable in its own right. (Jacqueline Marina, Purdue University <i>APA Newsletter on Teaching Philosophy, September 1998</i>)<br><br>Audi and Wolterstorff have provided us with a robust exchange, one that is accessible to a wide audience yet sophisticated enough to appeal to specialists in the field. As political theorists and philosophers continue to take up these issues, they would be wise to turn to this text for guidance on how to understand these questions from the perspective of contemporary philosophers of religion. (Brett T. Wilmot, Chicago, Illinois <i>The Journal Of Religion</i>)<br><br>Singly and by their disagreements, Audi and Wolterstorff show how complex is the issue of what role religious convictions may play in the public life of liberal democracies. Their debate is itself a model of the richer political discussion our society needs. (Charles Larmore, Columbia University)<br><br>Anyone wanting a deeper understanding of the philosophical issues at stake in the debate between liberal neutrality and faith-based morality needs to study this book carefully. (<i>Ethics and Medicine</i>)<br><br>The book is of a model clarity , careful thinking, and reasoned dialogue. It makes a valuable contribution to the religion and liberalism debate. (<i>Religious Studies Review</i>)<br><br>Audi and Wolterstoff demonstrate the complex realities surrounding religious and political arguments concerning the need for a consistent ethical rationale for determining the proper presence of religious principles in political debate. Their arguments highlight the contemporary dialogue between political liberalism and theologically based responses. (<i>Andrews University Seminary Studies</i>)<br><br>This book is a carefully reasoned and temperate discussion on both sides. It deserves to be read by all concerned about issues of church and state.

Paton's initial career was spent teaching in schools for the sons of rich, white South Africans, But at thirty, he suffered a severe attack of enteric fever, and in the time he had to reflect upon his life, he decided that he did not want to spend his life teaching the sons of the rich. He got a job as principal of Diepkloof Reformatory, a huge prison school for delinquent black boys, on the edge of Johannesburg. He worked at Diepkloof for ten years, and at the end of it Paton felt so strongly that he needed a change, that he sold his life insurance policies to finance a prison-study trip that took him to Scandinavia, England, and the United States. It was during this time that he unexpectedly wrote his first published novel, <i>Cry, the Beloved Country</i>. It stands as the single most important novel in South African literature.

It offers extensive treatment of the Hellenistic and Renaissance periods--which are typically given only minimal coverage in other anthologies--and devotes substantial chapters to nineteenth- and twentieth-century philosophy. The selections are organized historically and are presented in short and manageable sections with organizational headings and subheadings; archaic and difficult material has been adapted for clarity. Accompanying commentaries simplify difficult passages, explain technical terminology, and expand upon allusions to unfamiliar literature and arguments. Study questions are interspersed throughout the chapters in "Ask Yourself" boxes and vary with respect to format and level of difficulty. They require students to reconstruct arguments, summarize passages, complete blanks in statements and arguments, evaluate the success or viability of a philosophical point, or draw contemporary parallels and applications. The questions are carefully framed so as to avoid commitment to any particular side in controversies. Instructors can assign those questions that will best suit the aims of their courses and aid their students' comprehension of the primary source material. <em>A Historical Introduction to Philosophy</em> is enhanced by a comprehensive time line, a glossary, and lists of suggested further readings for both primary and secondary sources. This rich and flexible anthology and interactive textbook is ideal for introduction to philosophy and history of philosophy courses.<br></p><p>Norman Lillegard is at University of Tennessee at Martin."By far the best introduction to philosophy I've encountered.

Chapters highlight the connections between the common knowledge base, programs, and methodologies of special education and those of bilingual education in order to explore the ways to help exceptional children of Asian, African, Hispanic, and Native-American heritage. Practical information is balanced with strong research. <b> </b> Topics include: a judicial perspective on bilingual special education; a development of the bilingual special education interface; language acquisition; issues and assessment; procedures and techniques for assessment; individualized educational programs; instructional plans and curriculum development; methods and materials; family involvement; and issues in policy development and implementation. <b> </b> An excellent resource for teachers, counselors, psychologists, and speech/language specialists. </p></p><p><p> This book is about children who are learners at risk. They are bilingual or are from bilingual homes and sometimes have legitimate special education needs. We see a tremendous need for a meaningful interface between bilingual education and special education. During the last 40 years, special education classes were over-promoted and misused for these students in many parts of the United States. Declaring a student "mentally retarded," "learning disabled," or otherwise in need of special education and placing the child in a special class or resource room became an accepted method of educating ethnically, linguistically, and socio-economically different children. In some cases these children had authentic disabilities, but in other cases their linguistic or cultural background was the primary factor in their low test scores and subsequent special education placement. Because of the strong emphasis on inclusion and whole-school programs, the decades of the 1990s and 2000s have presented new challenges in properly identifying and serving these students. </p> <p> Because of the tremendous increase in the numbers of Asian, Hispanic, and Native American students, school districts have been unable to ignore the need for adjusting instructional programs and service delivery models to better serve these groups and other linguistically and culturally different individuals. One result has been the improvement and expansion of bilingual education to provide for the educational needs of the students with limited proficiency in English. But the bilingual student with special learning needs, including authentic disabilities, continues to be improperly identified and inappropriately served in many school districts. It is on this group of learners that we focus our attention in this text. By interfacing the common knowledge base, programs, and methodologies of bilingual education and special education, we believe that these learners can achieve success and maximize their potential. </p> <p> John Dewey's famous dictum that "what the best and wisest father wants for his child, the state should want for all its children" continues to have special significance today." By "all," we mean Anglo, Asian, Hispanic, Native American, African American, the poor, the rich, and all other linguistic, ethnic, cultural, and socioeconomic groups in the United States. </p> <p><b>Objective of This Book</b></p> <p> We have written this book as a resource for both regular and special education teacher trainers, staff developers, consultants, and others engaged in the preparation of ancillary school personnel, such as school counselors, psychologists, and speech and language specialists. It is designed to familiarize educators with the major needs of the exceptional child with limited skills in English. We provide information on inclusion, model programs, curriculum, and strategies for better educating this unique population of students. </p> <p><b>Organization and Flexibility</b></p> <p> We organized this text to emphasize the interface between bilingual and special education. We carefully sequenced the chapters to familiarize you with key issues from both areas and to demonstrate the creative convergence that can result when these two educational approaches are meaningfully integrated in an inclusive and collaborative environment. The major issues within the emerging field of bilingual special education have all been included in the text. We have tried to strike a balance between the theoretical and the practical dimensions of the material. </p> <p> We wrote this book to promote maximum flexibility as well as breadth of coverage. Although it is designed as a text for courses in special education, bilingual education, and bilingual special education, certain chapters can also be used as supplementary material for many other education courses. By using the reference list and appendixes, you can achieve greater depth and breadth of treatment. </p> <p><b>Features of the Fourth Edition</b></p> <p> In response to comments from users of the earlier editions and from our reviewers, we have made some important changes and additions to this edition of the text. First, we have updated the conceptual framework and assumptions undergirding bilingual special education. We also have updated the material in keeping with the growing body of research in this area, the current state of "best" professional practice, and current legislation and regulatory requirements. Furthermore, we have added new material and current references to all the chapters. We have reworked the chapters on language acquisition and assessment to reflect the current research in these areas. The revised chapter on consultation greatly strengthens the text and helps situate it in the context of collaborative inclusion. </p></p><h2>Handbook of Edible Weeds</h2><p>&#34;If you can&#39;t beat it, eat it.&#34; Words of wisdom from the author of this portable guide that emphasizes finding practical uses for weeds rather than waging pesticidal war on them. CRC Handbook of Edible Weeds contains detailed descriptions and illustrations of 100 edible weeds, representing 100 genera of higher plant species. Some of the species are strictly American, but many are cosmopolitan weeds. Each account includes common names recognized by the Weed Science Society of America, standard Latin scientific names, uses, and distribution (geographic and ecological). Cautionary notes are included regarding the potential allergenic or other harmful properties of many of the weeds. CRC Handbook of Edible Weeds is an excellent volume for botanists, plant scientists, horticulturalists, herbalists, and others interested in the edibility and practical uses of weeds.</p><p></p><h2>Introduction to International Political Economy (6th Edition)</h2><p><p> <b> <i>A complete and accessible overview of how politics and economics collide in a global context</i> </b> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This text surveys the theories, institutions, and relationships that characterize IPE and highlights them in a diverse range of regional and transnational issues.

His research focus lies at the interface of clinical psychology and psychophysiology (particularly EEG), as related to anxiety, dissociation, emotionality, and motoric processes. Part of this work has been basic in nature, as reflected in trying to understand what basic psychophysiological measures can tell us, as well as how they can be applied.

Yet, innovation is notoriously difficult. Only 1 in 100 new products are successful enough to cover development costs, and even fewer impact a company's growth trajectory. So how do you pinpoint the winning ideas that customers will love? <br>&nbsp;<br>Sifting through purchasing data for clues about what might sell or haphazardly brainstorming ideas are typical strategies. But <i>Jobs to Be Done </i>offers a far more precise and effective approach: determining the drivers of customer behavior--those functional and emotional goals that people want to achieve. Using the Jobs method, it becomes easy to see that people don't really need a 1/4-inch drill bit, but a 1/4-inch hole.

Written for the reader with a modest statistical background and minimal knowledge of SAS software, Survival Analysis Using SAS: A Practical Guide teaches many aspects of data input and manipulation. Numerous examples of SAS code and output make this an eminently practical resource, ensuring that even the uninitiated becomes a sophisticated user of survival analysis. The main topics presented include censoring, survival curves, Kaplan-Meier estimation, accelerated failure time models, Cox regression models, and discrete-time analysis. Also included are topics not usually covered, such as time-dependent covariates, competing risks, and repeated events.</p><p>Paul D. Allison is Professor of Sociology at the University of Pennsylvania where he teaches graduate courses in survival analysis and categorical data analysis. Every summer he teaches a five-day workshop on survival analysis that is attended by researchers from around the United States and Canada. Besides his numerous statistical papers, he has also published extensively on the subject of scientists&#39; careers.Written to presume only a basic knowledge of regression analysis and linear models, this is marvelously fluent and presents the survival-analysis material in an enjoyable and readable style. Some of the indigenous topics-such as competing risks, repeated events, multiple events, and event history-receive more emphasis in this book than in most other survival-analysis books. The book incidentally does a nice job of explaining the features in SAS that differentiate SAS survival-analysis capabilities from the capabilities of other (unnamed) survival-analysis software. --Eric R. Ziegel, Technometrics, Book Review Editor<br><br>A very informative and practical text for statisticians and applied researchers interested in analyzing time-to-event data. The chapters are concise, well written and packed with useful real life examples. The underlying theory is clearly presented and supplemented with numerous diagrams and tables. Basic survival concepts and methods, such as parametric regression modeling, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Cox regression are superbly covered. Yet, the text does not shy away from more advanced topics including accelerated failure-time model, time-dependent covariates, and competing risk models. --Jimmy Thomas Efird, Roche Global Development<br><br>Allison has put together an excellent resource for survival analysis for the novice, researchers with a limited knowledge of statistics and those with extensive knowledge of statistics. His book contains nine chapters. The first two are introductory information on survival analysis including what survival analysis is, when and why one would use this technique, and approaches to survival analysis including life tables, Kaplan-Meier (KM), exponential regression, and proportional hazard regression. A description of probability functions, including the hazard function are explained in a manner that is easily understood. Chapter 3 explains using the procedure PROC LIFETEST, which produces estimates of survival functions using life tables or KM. Examples and sample data sets are provided for this procedure, and others that follow. Chapter 4 explains the procedure PROC LIFEREG, which produces estimates of parametric regression models with censored survival data using the method of maximum likelihood. Chapter 5 explains use of the procedure PROC PHREG which is proportional hazard modeling or the cox regression model. This procedure is fairly new, and only recently has been included in the core SAS STAT modules. The proportional hazard model has many applications due to the non-parametric nature of the model. Unlike PROC LIFEREG, PHREG does not depend on choosing a particular probability distribution to represent survival times. Allison's description of the model and the syntax for SAS is very easy to follow. Chapter 6 explains concept of competing risks and how to deal with them in the procedures already explained. Chapter 7 explains using PROC LOGISTIC, PROBIT and GENMOD when a survival history is broken down into a set of discrete observations. This chapter provides a quick summary of logistic regression models using SAS, and users with an advance need in this area should use the book Logistic Regression Examples which contains much more detail.

However, as always in Hugo, a degree of endearing self-glorification is never absent. <em>The Last Day of a Condemned Man</em>, while not seeking to minimalize its protagonist's responsibility for the murder he has committed, reminds the reader of the mental anguish endured by a man condemned to a cell. <em>Claude Gueux</em> is a documentary account of the martyrdom of a prisoner driven to crime by poverty, and to murder by the casual brutality of a head warder.

The purpose of this book is to deconstruct early childhood education, identifying and evaluating the themes and forms of discourse that have dominated the field, leading to the construction of specific theories and forms of practice that privilege particular groups of children and adults and oppress others. An alternative avenue for early childhood education is posited that focuses on social justice and human agency.</p><p>The Author: Gaile Sloan Cannella is an associate professor of early childhood and multicultural education at Texas A&amp;M University. She received her Ed.D. in early childhood education from the University of Georgia. In addition to numerous research articles in professional journals concerned with the education of young children, she has written on social justice and teacher education.�Can there be a more important scholar in early childhood education? Gaile Sloan Cannella has indeed reconceptualized the field! No scholar, no student can proceed from this moment on without first grappling with what Dr. Cannella has written in this paradigmatic work. Congratulations to Gaile Cannella and congratulations to the field!� (William F. Pinar, St. Bernard Parish Alumni Endowed Professor, Louisiana State University)<br> �&#x2018;Deconstructing Early Childhood Education: Social Justice and Revolution&#x2019; represents an important moment in the larger revolution of childhood studies. Along with a cadre of other pioneers, Cannella refuses to accept traditional notions of child development, the sacrosanct research methods used to study childhood, the portrayal of childhood as a fixed, unchanging entity, or the &#x2018;validated&#x2019; educational strategies used to teach young children. At the same time she understands these dynamics; she appreciates the fact that those who advocate the traditional view are typically individuals who have dedicated their lives to making life better for children. As she points out in Chapter 8 of this work, her attempt is not to simply debase the work of childhood educators who came before her. Her effort is to catalyze a critical conversation about the discourse of early childhood in a way that opens to view perspectives that are too often oppressive in their efforts.<br> Refusing the seduction of specified blueprints for reinvented early childhood education, the author allows for multiple responses to her deconstructive project. As a handbook for early childhood educators dedicated to escaping the webs of power the discipline has successfully spun, &#x2018;Deconstructing Early Childhood Education&#x2019; will occupy a central role in the revolution of childhood studies.� (Joe L.

This new biography of George Eliot goes beyond the much-told story of her life. It gives an account of what it means to become a novelist, and to think like a novelist: in particular a realist novelist for whom art exists not for art's sake but in the exploration and service of human life. It shows the formation and the workings of George Eliot's mind as it plays into her creation of some of the greatest novels of the Victorian era. <br><br>When at the age of 37 Marian Evans became George Eliot, this change followed long mental preparation and personal suffering. During this time she related her power of intelligence to her capacity for feeling: discovering that her thinking and her art had to combine both. That was the great ambition of her novelsnot to be mere pastimes or fictions but experiments in life and helps in living, through the deepest account of human complexity available. Philip Davis's illuminating new biography will enable you both to see through George Eliot's eyes and to feel what it is like to be seen by her, in the imaginative involvement of her readers with her characters.<br></p><p><br>Philip Davis, <em>University of Liverpool</em><br><br>Philip Davis is the author of <em>The Victorians 1830-1880</em>, volume 8 in the Oxford English Literary History Series, and a companion volume on <em>Why Victorian Literature Still Matters</em>.

Because the truth is, the longer they take to launch their company, the more changes there will be in the marketplace--causing their business to be outdated before it even begins!Today&#x2019;s entrepreneurs must avoid the temptation to play it safe and launch a business in a bubble. Instead, they need to embrace the idea of &#x201c;failing fast.&#x201d; Almost upon genesis of the idea, it is detrimental for the entrepreneur to connect with real customers and determine quickly whether their idea is worth pursuing, needs new direction, or should be abandoned altogether.In the groundbreaking, tell-it-like-it-is Fail Fast or Win Big, entrepreneurs will learn how to: � Create a rapid prototype of their product or service� Develop a business model instead of a business plan� Test it repeatedly with customers so they can spot failure early� Continue to refine the model based on customer interactions� Leverage their network and resources in order to run leanComplete with real-life examples of entrepreneurs who set out to fail fast and ended up winning big, Fail Fast or Win Big is the business plan you didn&#x2019;t study in college.

But with the marketplace changing at lightning speed, this notion is not only outdated&#x2014;it&#x2019;s costly. </p> <p> </p> <p> There&#x2019;s no point to building a business in a bubble. Today&#x2019;s entrepreneurs must embrace the idea of &#x201c;failing fast.&#x201d; They need to connect with real customers and determine quickly whether their idea is worth pursuing, needs new direction, or should be abandoned altogether. <i>Fail Fast or Win Big </i>shows entrepreneurs how to: </p> <p> </p> <p> Create a rapid prototype of their product or service � Develop a business model instead of a business plan � Test it repeatedly with customers so they can spot failure early � Continue to refine the model based on customer interactions � Leverage their network and resources in order to run lean </p> <p> </p> <p> The longer it takes to launch a company, the more changes there will have been in the market place. Featuring real-life examples of entrepreneurs who set out to fail fast and ended up winning big, this ground breaking guide reveals how the right kind of risk can really pay off. </p><p> As an entrepreneur, you are not in the business of writing business plans. You need to move faster. Market conditions evolve so rapidly today that by the time you could perfect a business plan, it would likely be obsolete and your competitors would have already beaten you to market. It makes more sense to remain lean, flexible, and willing to change with the marketplace. You need a new way of thinking and doing. </p> <p> </p> <p> The LeanModel Framework&#x2122; is your way forward. This business framework strategy lets you forego many of the most time-consuming and least productive elements of business planning in favor of getting a working prototype of your service or product to market in 90 days or sooner. Doing so will supply you much more quickly with the information most crucial to your business trajectory: initial customer feedback, from which you make the decision to tinker or rethink your approach, scale up, or even abandon ship. </p> <p> </p> <p> A LeanModel strategy will also endear you to today&#x2019;s investors. Instead of selling them on a perfect business plan, you&#x2019;re much better off selling them on an actual product or service&#x2014;even a rough prototype&#x2014;that you know you can test in the marketplace. And if nobody&#x2019;s buying, then you&#x2019;ve failed fast and can move on to your next win. </p> <p> </p> <p> <i>Fail Fast or Win Big</i>, based on the author&#x2019;s more than 20 years spent helping small companies become market leaders, helps you get right down to it with strategies for: </p> <p> </p> <p> � Leveraging your own network for expert advice and potential early customers </p> <p> � Anticipating how and when markets for your product will form, intersect, and morph into new opportunities </p> <p> � Incorporating customer truth at your earliest stages of development </p> <p> � Rapidly developing and deploying prototypes into test markets </p> <p> � Leveraging lessons learned and even abject failures into your next launch&#x2014;immediately </p> <p> � Finding funding from new and unconventional sources </p> <p> </p> <p> You need to believe that if you can&#x2019;t really identify and create a solid business model, utilize lean resources, rapidly create a prototype, and seek customer truth repeatedly, the odds of creating a successful company just went down. </p> <p> </p> <p> In other words, quit planning&#x2014;and start doing. </p> <p> </p> <p> Bernhard Schroeder is the Director of Programs at the Lavin Entrepreneurship Center at San Diego State University, one of <i>Forbes&#x2019;</i> Top 20 Schools for Entrepreneurship.

A new word burst into popular usage to describe these descents into the precincts of poverty to see how the poor lived: slumming. In this captivating book, Seth Koven paints a vivid portrait of the practitioners of slumming and their world: who they were, why they went, what they claimed to have found, how it changed them, and how slumming, in turn, powerfully shaped both Victorian and twentieth-century understandings of poverty and social welfare, gender relations, and sexuality.</p><br><p> The slums of late-Victorian London became synonymous with all that was wrong with industrial capitalist society. But for philanthropic men and women eager to free themselves from the starched conventions of bourgeois respectability and domesticity, slums were also places of personal liberation and experimentation. Slumming allowed them to act on their irresistible "attraction of repulsion" for the poor and permitted them, with society's approval, to get dirty and express their own "dirty" desires for intimacy with slum dwellers and, sometimes, with one another.</p><br><p> Slumming elucidates the histories of a wide range of preoccupations about poverty and urban life, altruism and sexuality that remain central in Anglo-American culture, including the ethics of undercover investigative reporting, the connections between cross-class sympathy and same-sex desire, and the intermingling of the wish to rescue the poor with the impulse to eroticize and sexually exploit them.</p><br><p> By revealing the extent to which politics and erotics, social and sexual categories overflowed their boundaries and transformed one another, Koven recaptures the ethical dilemmas that men and women confronted--and continue to confront--in trying to "love thy neighbor as thyself."</p></p><p>Winner of the 2005 Sonya Rudikoff Book Award, Northeast Victorian Studies Association<p>"Arresting. Koven's scholarship is excellent, and this book will appeal across a wide range of disciplines."<b>--James Epstein, Vanderbilt University</b></p><p>"New, fresh and original. Koven is an indefatigable and energetic researcher, and he looks at cross-class benevolence and the settlement house movement from a new perspective."<b>--Susan Pedersen, Columbia University</b></p><p>"This is a brilliantly crafted, deeply researched, and provocative cultural history. Seth Koven paints a vivid picture of Victorian and Edwardian slummers and the social and sexual politics that impelled their urban journeys. This book is essential reading for cultural critics, historians, urbanists, and scholars of gender and sexuality. It is interdisciplinary history of the highest order."<b>--Judith R. Walkowitz, author of <i>City of Dreadful Delight: Narratives of Sexual Danger in Late-Victorian London</i></b></p><p>"<i>Slumming</i> adds a new and vital dimension to the modern history of London. Historians have spent much time examining the changing condition of outcast London but little on those whose investigations and explorations revealed that condition. As Seth Koven reveals, 'slumming' was more than a matter of religious or political concern. It was exciting, transgressive, and a way of discovering or releasing another person within the self."<b>--Gareth Stedman Jones, author of <i>Outcast London</i></b></p><p>"Seth Koven's much awaited <i>Slumming</i> gives us a vivid, authoritative, and astute new history of the Victorian phenomenon that took hundreds of middle-class men and women into urban 'nether worlds' of poverty and deprivation. More than any other previous chronicler of this cultural trend, Koven makes clear that motives for slumming were complex and morally ambiguous. He also reminds us that Victorian renderings of children and the poor inaugurated a tradition of representation in which compassion and voyeurism coexist uncomfortably and, perhaps, inevitably."<b>--Deborah Epstein Nord, author of <i>Walking the Victorian Streets: Women, Representation, and the City</i></b></p><p>"The stories Seth Koven tells in <i>Slumming</i> and his insights and analyses of them are intriguing and convincing. The reader will be fascinated by his intertwining of sexuality, particularly in its homoerotic dimension, with activities designed to help the poor.

He first lays the groundwork for the book&#39;s dual focus, opening with a discussion of depressions. He then focuses on the historical perspective of depression and hypnosis as &#34;forbidden friends,&#34; shedding new light on old myths about the use of hypnosis leading to hysteria, and even suicide. The result is a definition of hypnosis as a flexible and enlightened tool that offers precisely the multidimensionality that the problem demands.</p><p></p><h2>A Catechism for Business: Tough Ethical Questions and Insights from Catholic Teaching</h2><p>This second edition streamlines some of the editing from the first addition, and more importantly, includes material from Pope Francis's encyclical, <i>Laudato Si'</i>, and his apostolic exhortation, <i>Evangelii Gaudium</i>.<i> A Catechism for Business</i> presents the teachings of the Catholic Church as they relate to more than one hundred specific and challenging moral questions as they have been asked by business leaders. Andrew V. Abela and Joseph E. Capizzi have assembled the relevant quotations from recent Catholic social teaching as responses to these questions. Questions and answers are grouped together under major topics such as marketing, finance and investment. The book's easy-to-use question and answer approach invites quick reference for tough questions and serves as a basis for reflection and deeper study in the rich Catholic tradition of social doctrine.</p><p>&nbsp;<br>This is a fantastic repository!&nbsp; It should be mandatory reading for any Catholic in business, and recommended reading for any non-Catholic interested in what the Church really teaches.<br><i>Patrick Lencioni, author of&nbsp;</i>The Advantage<i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</i>The Five Dysfunctions of a Team<i></i><br>&nbsp;<br><br>The Church's social teachings are a "best-kept secret" because they are often presented as answers without questions.&nbsp; Dr. Capizzi and Dean Abela have provided the questions, from the heart of the business enterprise, along with accurate but succinct responses from Catholic social doctrine.&nbsp; In their expert hands, the teaching has a chance to be heard.<br> <i>Francis Cardinal George, O.M.I., Archbishop of Chicago</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Work is not only a necessary activity but a beautiful expression of our creative nature, and this book is a vital resource for anyone who wishes to align work--and the workplace--according to God's love and vision of the human person.

His brilliant dialogue, combined with his use of paradox and socialist theory, never fails to tickle, entertain&#x2014;and challenge.</p><p>George Bernard Shaw (1856-1950) is one of the world&#x2019;s greatest literary figures. Born in Dublin, Ireland, he left school at fourteen and in 1876 went to London, where he began his literary career with a series of unsuccessful novels. In 1884 he became a founder of the Fabian Society, the famous British socialist organization. After becoming a reviewer and drama critic, he published a study of the Norwegian dramatist Henrik Ibsen in 1891 and became determined to create plays as he felt Ibsen did: to shake audiences out of their moral complacency and to attack social problems. However, Shaw was an irrepressible wit, and his plays are as entertaining as they are socially provocative. Basically shy, Shaw created a public persona for himself: G.B.S., a bearded eccentric, crusading social critic, antivivisectionist, language reformer, strict vegetarian, and renowned public speaker. The author of fifty-three plays, hundreds of essays, reviews, and letters, and several books, Shaw is best known for <i>Widowers&#x2019; Houses</i> (1892), <i>Mrs. Warren&#x2019;s Profession</i> (1893), <i>Arms and the Man</i> (1894), <i>Caesar and Cleopatra</i> (1898), <i>Man and Superman</i> (1903), <i>Major Barbara</i> (1905), <i>Pygmalion</i> (1913), <i>Heartbreak House</i> (1919), and <i>Saint Joan</i> (1923). He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1925.<i>Major Barbara<br>ACT I</i><br>(It is after dinner on a January night, in the library in LADY BRITOMART UNDERSHAFT's house in Wilton Crescent. A large and comfortable settee is in the middle of the room, upholstered in dark leather. A person sitting on it (it is vacant at present) would have, on his right, LADY BRITOMART's writing-table, with the lady herself busy at it; a smaller writing-table behind him on his left; the door behind him on LADY BRITOMART's side; and a window with a window-seat directly on his left. Near the window is an armchair.<br><br>LADY BRITOMART is a woman of fifty or thereabouts, well dressed and yet careless of her dress, well bred and quite reckless of her breeding, well mannered and yet appallingly outspoken and indifferent to the opinion of her interlocutors, amiable and yet peremptory, arbitrary, and high-tempered to the last bearable degree, and withal a very typical managing matron of the upper class, treated as a naughty child until she grew into a scolding mother, and finally settling down with plenty of practical ability and worldly experience, limited in the oddest way with domestic and class limitations, conceiving the universe exactly as if it were a large house in Wilton Crescent, though handling her corner of it very effectively on that assumption, and being quite enlightened and liberal as to the books in the library, the pictures on the walls, the music in the portfolios, and the articles in the papers.<br><br>Her son, STEPHEN, comes in. He is a gravely correct young man under 25, taking himself very seriously, but still in some awe of his mother, from childish habit and bachelor shyness rather than from any weakness of character.)<br><br>STEPHEN. What's the matter?<br><br>LADY BRITOMART. Presently, Stephen.<br><br>(STEPHEN submissively walks to the settee and sits down. He takes up The Speaker.)<br><br>LADY BRITOMART. Don&#x2019;t begin to read, Stephen. I shall require all your attention.<br><br>STEPHEN. It was only while I was waiting&#x2014;<br><br>LADY BRITOMART. Don&#x2019;t make excuse, Stephen. (He puts down The Speaker.) Now! (She finishes her writing; rises; and comes to the settee.) I have not kept you waiting very long, I think.<br><br>STEPHEN. Not at all, mother.<br><br>LADY BRITOMART. Bring me my cushion. (He takes the cushion from the chair at the desk and arranges it for her as she sits down on the settee.) Sit down. (He sits down and fingers his tie nervously.) Don&#x2019;t fiddle with your tie, Stephen: there is nothing the matter with it.<br><br>STEPHEN. I beg your pardon. (He fiddles with his watch chain instead.)<br><br>LADY BRITOMART. Now are you attending to me, Stephen?<br><br>STEPHEN. Of course, mother.<br><br>LADY BRITOMART. No, it's not of course. I want something much more than your everyday matter-of-course attention. I am going to speak to you very seriously, Stephen. I wish you would let that chain alone.<br><br>STEPHEN (hastily relinquishing the chain). Have I done anything to annoy you, mother? If so, it was quite unintentional.<br><br>LADY BRITOMART (astonished). Nonsense! (With some remorse.) My poor boy, did you think I was angry with you?<br><br>STEPHEN. What is it, then, mother? You are making me very uneasy.<br><br>LADY BRITOMART (squaring herself at him rather aggressively). Stephen: may I ask how soon you intend to realize that you are a grown-up man, and that I am only a woman?<br><br>STEPHEN (amazed). Only a&#x2014;<br><br>LADY BRITOMART. Don&#x2019;t repeat my words, please: it is a most aggravating habit. You must learn to face life seriously, Stephen. I really cannot bear the whole burden of our family affairs any longer. You must advise me: you must assume the responsibility.<br><br>STEPHEN. I!<br><br>LADY BRITOMART. Yes, you, of course. You were 24 last June. You&#x2019;ve been at Harrow and Cambridge. You&#x2019;ve been to India and Japan. You must know a lot of things, now; unless you have wasted your time most scandalously. Well, advise me.<br><br>STEPHEN (much perplexed). You know I have never interfered in the household&#x2014;<br><br>LADY BRITOMART. No: I should think not. I don&#x2019;t want you to order the dinner.<br><br>STEPHEN. I mean in our family affairs.<br><br>LADY BRITOMART. Well, you must interfere now; for they are getting quite beyond me.<br><br>STEPHEN (troubled). I have thought sometimes that perhaps I ought; but really, mother, I know so little about them; and what I do know is so painful&#x2014;it is so impossible to mention some things to you&#x2014; (he stops, ashamed).<br><br>LADY BRITOMART. I suppose you mean your father.<br><br>STEPHEN (almost inaudibly). Yes.<br><br>LADY BRITOMART. My dear: we cant go on all our lives not mentioning him. Of course you were quite right not to open the subject until I asked you to; but you are old enough now to be taken into my confidence, and to help me to deal with him about the girls.<br><br>STEPHEN. But the girls are all right. They are engaged.<br><br>LADY BRITOMART (complacently). Yes: I have made a very good match for Sarah. Charles Lomax will be a millionaire at 35. But that is ten years ahead; and in the meantime his trustees cannot under the terms of his father's will allow him more than �800 a year.<br><br>STEPHEN. But the will says also that if he increases his income by his own exertions, they may double the increase.<br><br>LADY BRITOMART. Charles Lomax's exertions are much more likely to decrease his income than to increase it. Sarah will have to find at least another �800 a year for the next ten years; and even then they will be as poor as church mice. And what about Barbara? I thought Barbara was going to make the most brilliant career of all of you. And what does she do? Joins the Salvation Army; discharges her maid; lives on a pound a week; and walks in one evening with a professor of Greek whom she has picked up in the street, and who pretends to be a Salvationist, and actually plays the big drum for her in public because he has fallen head over ears in love with her.<br><br>STEPHEN. I was certainly rather taken aback when I heard they were engaged. Cusins is a very nice fellow, certainly: nobody would ever guess that he was born in Australia; but&#x2014;<br><br>LADY BRITOMART. Oh, Adolphus Cusins will make a very good husband. After all, nobody can say a word against Greek: it stamps a man at once as an educated gentleman. And my family, thank Heaven, is not a pig-headed Tory one. We are Whigs, and believe in liberty. Let snobbish people say what they please: Barbara shall marry, not the man they like, but the man I like.<br><br>STEPHEN. Of course I was thinking only of his income. However, he is not likely to be extravagant.<br><br>LADY BRITOMART. Don&#x2019;t be too sure of that, Stephen. I know your quiet, simple, refined, poetic people like Adolphus&#x2014;quite content with the best of everything! They cost more than your extravagant people, who are always as mean as they are second rate. No: Barbara will need at least �2000 a year. You see it means two additional households. Besides, my dear, you must marry soon. I don&#x2019;t approve of the present fashion of philandering bachelors and late marriages; and I am trying to arrange something for you.<br><br>STEPHEN. It's very good of you, mother; but perhaps I had better arrange that for myself.<br><br>LADY BRITOMART. Nonsense! you are much too young to begin matchmaking: you would be taken in by some pretty little nobody. Of course I don&#x2019;t mean that you are not to be consulted: you know that as well as I do. (STEPHEN closes his lips and is silent.) Now don&#x2019;t sulk, Stephen.<br><br>STEPHEN. I am not sulking, mother. What has all this got to do with&#x2014;with&#x2014;with my father?<br><br>LADY BRITOMART. My dear Stephen: where is the money to come from? It is easy enough for you and the other children to live on my income as long as we are in the same house; but I cant keep four families in four separate houses. You know how poor my father is: he has barely seven thousand a year now; and really, if he were not the Earl of Stevenage, he would have to give up society. He can do nothing for us. He says, naturally enough, that it is absurd that he should be asked to provide for the children of a man who is rolling in money. You see, Stephen, your father must be fabulously wealthy, because there is always a war going on somewhere.<br><br>STEPHEN. You need not remind me of that, mother. I have hardly ever opened a newspaper in my life without seeing our name in it. The Undershaft torpedo! The Undershaft quick firers! The Undershaft ten inch! the Undershaft disappearing rampart gun! the Undershaft submarine! and now the Undershaft aerial battleship! At Harrow they called me the Woolwich Infant. At Cambridge it was the same. A little brute at King's who was always trying to get up revivals, spoilt my Bible&#x2014;your first birthday present to me&#x2014;by writing under my name, "Son and heir to Undershaft and Lazarus, Death and Destruction Dealers: address, Christendom and Judea." But that was not so bad as the way I was kowtowed to everywhere because my father was making millions by selling cannons.<br><br>LADY BRITOMART. It is not only the cannons, but the war loans that Lazarus arranges under cover of giving credit for the cannons. You know, Stephen, it's perfectly scandalous. Those two men, Andrew Undershaft and Lazarus, positively have Europe under their thumbs. That is why your father is able to behave as he does. He is above the law. Do you think Bismarck or Gladstone or Disraeli could have openly defied every social and moral obligation all their lives as your father has? They simply wouldn&#x2019;t have dared. I asked Gladstone to take it up. I asked the Times to take it up. I asked the Lord Chamberlain to take it up. But it was just like asking them to declare war on the Sultan. They wouldn&#x2019;t. They said they couldn&#x2019;t touch him. I believe they were afraid.<br><br>STEPHEN. What could they do? He does not actually break the law.<br><br>LADY BRITOMART. Not break the law! He is always breaking the law. He broke the law when he was born: his parents were not married.<br><br>STEPHEN. Mother! Is that true?<br><br>LADY BRITOMART. Of course it's true: that was why we separated.<br><br>STEPHEN. He married without letting you know this!<br><br>LADY BRITOMART (rather taken aback by this inference). Oh no. To do Andrew justice, that was not the sort of thing he did. Besides, you know the Undershaft motto: Unashamed. Everybody knew.<br>STEPHEN. But you said that was why you separated.<br><br>LADY BRITOMART. Yes, because he was not content with being a foundling himself: he wanted to disinherit you for another foundling. That was what I couldn&#x2019;t stand.<br><br>STEPHEN (ashamed). Do you mean for&#x2014;for&#x2014;for&#x2014;<br><br>LADY BRITOMART. Don&#x2019;t stammer, Stephen. Speak distinctly.<br><br>STEPHEN. But this is so frightful to me, mother. To have to speak to you about such things!<br><br>LADY BRITOMART. It's not pleasant for me, either, especially if you are still so childish that you must make it worse by a display of embarrassment. It is only in the middle classes, Stephen, that people get into a state of dumb helpless horror when they find that there are wicked people in the world. In our class, we have to decide what is to be done with wicked people; and nothing should disturb our self-possession. Now ask your question properly.<br><br>STEPHEN. Mother: you have no consideration for me. For Heaven's sake either treat me as a child, as you always do, and tell me nothing at all; or tell me everything and let me take it as best I can.<br><br>LADY BRITOMART. Treat you as a child! What do you mean? It is most unkind and ungrateful of you to say such a thing. You know I have never treated any of you as children. I have always made you my companions and friends, and allowed you perfect freedom to do and say whatever you liked, so long as you liked what I could approve of.<br><br>STEPHEN (desperately). I daresay we have been the very imperfect children of a very perfect mother; but I do beg you to let me alone for once, and tell me about this horrible business of my father wanting to set me aside for another son.<br><br>LADY BRITOMART (amazed). Another son! I never said anything of the kind. I never dreamt of such a thing. This is what comes of interrupting me.<br><br>STEPHEN. But you said&#x2014;<br><br>LADY BRITOMART (cutting him short). Now be a good boy, Stephen, and listen to me patiently. The Undershafts are descended from a foundling in the parish of St. Andrew Undershaft in the city. That was long ago, in the reign of James the First. Well, this foundling was adopted by an armorer and gun-maker. In the course of time the foundling succeeded to the business; and from some notion of gratitude, or some vow or something, he adopted another foundling, and left the business to him. And that foundling did the same. Ever since that, the cannon business has always been left to an adopted foundling named Andrew Undershaft.<br><br>STEPHEN. But did they never marry? Were there no legitimate sons?<br><br>LADY BRITOMART. Oh yes: they married just as your father did; and they were rich enough to buy land for their own children and leave them well provided for. But they always adopted and trained some foundling to succeed them in the business; and of course they always quarrelled with their wives furiously over it. Your father was adopted in that way; and he pretends to consider himself bound to keep up the tradition and adopt somebody to leave the business to. Of course I was not going to stand that. There may have been some reason for it when the Undershafts could only marry women in their own class, whose sons were not fit to govern great estates. But there could be no excuse for passing over my son.<br><br>STEPHEN (dubiously). I am afraid I should make a poor hand of managing a cannon foundry.<br><br>LADY BRITOMART. Nonsense! you could easily get a manager and pay him a salary.<br><br>STEPHEN. My father evidently had no great opinion of my capacity.<br><br>LADY BRITOMART. Stuff, child! you were only a baby: it had nothing to do with your capacity. Andrew did it on principle, just as he did every perverse and wicked thing on principle. When my father remonstrated, Andrew actually told him to his face that history tells us of only two successful institutions: one the Undershaft firm, and the other the Roman Empire under the Antonines. That was because the Antonine emperors all adopted their successors. Such rubbish! The Stevenages are as good as the Antonines, I hope; and you are a Stevenage. But that was Andrew all over. There you have the man! Always clever and unanswerable when he was defending nonsense and wickedness: always awkward and sullen when he had to behave sensibly and decently!</p><h2>Comparative Politics: Rationality, Culture, and Structure, 2nd Edition (Cambridge Studies in Comparative Politics)</h2><p>Comparative Politics: Rationality, Culture, and Structure is a completely revised second edition of the volume that guided thousands of scholars through the intellectual demands and gratifications of comparative political science. Retaining a focus on the field&#39;s research schools, it now pays parallel attention to the pragmatics of causal research. Mark Lichbach begins with a review of discovery, explanation and evidence and Alan Zuckerman argues for explanations with social mechanisms. Ira Katznelson, writing on structuralist analyses, Margaret Levi on rational choice theory, and Marc Ross on culturalist analyses, assess developments in the field&#39;s research schools. Subsequent chapters explore the relationship among the paradigms and current research: Joel Migdal examines the state; Mark Blyth adds culturalist themes to work on political economy; Etel Solingen locates the international context of comparative politics; Doug McAdam, Charles Tilly, and Sidney Tarrow address contentious politics; Robert Huckfeldt explores multi-level analyses; Christopher Anderson describes nested voters; Jonathan Rodden examines endogenous institutions; Isabela Mares studies welfare states, and Kanchan Chandra proposes a causal account of ethnic politics. The volume offers a rigorous and exciting assessment of the past decade of scholarship in comparative politics.</p><p>Comparative Politics is a completely revised second edition of the volume that guided thousands of scholars through the intellectual demands and gratifications of comparative political science.

(<i>Library Preservation 2</i>)<br><br>The Preservation Management Handbook fills a void in current literature as a textbook for the preservation of information resources in the digital age. The editors and contributors to this volume have served the profession by mapping a new approach to a rapidly changing landscape. . . .The book includes clear explanations of the structure and vulnerabilities of library media and materials, from paper objects and books, to photographs, sound and moving-image materials, digital media, textiles, and paintings. . . . The Preservation Management Handbook is a good resource to keep within reach as an up-to-date compendium, and guide to other resources, on the preservation of library materials. (<i>Metropolitan Archivist</i>)<br><br>One of the book&#x2019;s strengths lies in the fact that it addresses the current issues surrounding digital (especially 'born digital') records. This is not surprising as Harvey has written extensively about the subject in other publications. Saving digital records is a growing challenge for most repositories, and it is important that this is addressed in any new overview alongside the more traditional materials and methods. The authors brought in additional specialists to contribute sections to the final part of the book, each in their respective area of expertise. As a result, each specific category of material (paper, photographs, etc.) receives a solid overview that provides a strong introduction for beginners. . . .[I]t is an excellent resource that provides a foundation on which to build further education.

Harvey and Mahard have made an important contribution to preservation by writing a book that will expand the forums in which its basic principles are considered. (Michele V.

Ezell, Ph.D., &amp; Laura M. Justice, Ph.D., CCC-S.</p><p>Copyright � 2005 by Paul H. Brookes Publishing Co. All rights reserved. No part of this excerpt may be reproduced or reprinted without permission in writing from the publisher.</p><p>During their preschool years, children must acquire sufficient knowledge of and facility with language for it to be become a useful tool in their formal education. This means that young children not only need to learn language for personal expression and communication with others but also need it to further their learning in an educational setting. Once formal education begins, children will rely on their reading, writing, speaking, and listening skills, all of which are dependent on an underlying foundation of language competence. Therefore, by helping young children become competent language users, professionals and parents will be building a solid foundation for children�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s future learning.</p><p>This book provides some ideas and strategies for assisting professionals in developing young children�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s language competence through one particular language-rich experience &#x2014; that of shared reading. Shared reading has been selected because of its unique quality of presenting both oral and written language simultaneously. This permits children to acquire not only oral language abilities but also early print concepts. Recent important research and policy documents, such as the consensus document <i>Preventing Reading Difficulties in Young Children</i> commissioned by the National Research Council (Snow, Burns, &amp; Griffin, 1998) and the position statement <i>Learning to Read and Write: Developmentally Appropriate Practices for Young Children</i> prepared jointly by the International Reading Association (IRA) and the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) (1998), emphasize the value of providing children generous access to storybooks and engaging them in high-quality interactive reading. These reports stress the role of storybooks in offering valuable experiences with the vocabulary and grammar of oral language, as well as intensive exposure to the sound and print structure of written language that underlies the alphabetic principle.</p><p>This book is intended to serve as a guide and resource for all professionals working with young children and their families, including early interventionists, child care providers, early childhood educators, kindergarten teachers, librarians, literacy coaches, speech language pathologists, special educators, psychologists, social workers, and health care providers. The focus of this book is to help professionals understand the inherent value and versatility of shared reading with young children for building a strong foundation of language and emergent literacy skills. Ultimately, children will apply this foundation to their experiences during the formal reading instruction that occurs in kindergarten and first grade.</p><p><b>DEVELOPING CHILDREN�&#x20ac;&#x2122;S LANGUAGE THROUGH SHARED READING</b></p><p>The term <i>shared reading</i> is used throughout this book to describe the interaction that occurs between an adult and a child when reading or looking at a book. This interaction may include one adult and one child, or one or more adults and several children. The interaction may occur in any setting (e.g., a child care center, a preschool classroom, an outpatient clinic, children�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s homes). Several different terms are used by experts to describe this interaction, including <i>interactive reading, reading aloud, book sharing, book reading, storybook reading, adult&#x2013;child storybook reading,</i> and <i>book-reading interaction</i>. All of these terms are interchangeable, essentially focused on giving a name to the important interactions that occur between adults and children when they share a storybook. In this book, the terms <i>book sharing</i> or <i>shared reading</i> are used to emphasize the active involvement and engagement of both the child and the adult in a shared interaction focusing on a book�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s words, pictures, and story.</p><p>This book is based on the premise that shared reading is a unique learning context for young children that involves much more than simply looking at pictures. Although one of the most salient features of storybooks is their illustrations, storybooks also provide children with access to a world of sights, sounds, and words that may be quite different from what they experience in their homes, their communities, and their schools. For example, it is through a storybook that a child may first experience the magic of the animal kingdom (e.g., lions, giraffes, camels, snakes, turtles). One popular book, <i>Dear Zoo</i> by Rod Campbell (1982), provides children from the earliest ages with the names of these and other animals, allowing them to experience vocabulary words that are not likely to arise in their everyday environments. A simple and often delightful text for even very young children, <i>Dear Zoo</i> exposes children to linguistic concepts that will be important as they develop, including the descriptive adjectives <i>grumpy, fierce, scary,</i> and <i>naughty</i>, as well as concepts about how to handle objects (e.g., <i>fragile, heavy</i>). It is hard to believe that a text containing only 31 different words used in 25 short sentences can help children develop such a range of early yet important concepts.</p><p>As another example, Jessica Stockham�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s <i>Down by the Station</i> (2002) allows children to experience a variety of onomatopoeic words describing the sounds of vehicles &#x2014; the chuff, chuff, chuff of the train; the brrm, brrm, brrm of the bus; the beep, beep, beep of the taxi; and the nee nor, nee nor, nee nor of the fire engine. Clearly, this storybook provides children with early exposure to the sounds of the world around them, all while sitting on the lap of an adult. Professionals can use this book and its systematic attention to words and sounds as a means for heightening children�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s early sensitivities to the sound structure of oral language and for understanding how words represent diverse aspects of their world, including its sounds.</p><p>These examples highlight how storybooks provide children with the words they can use to explore both basic and abstract vocabulary concepts. However, books do much more than teach children new vocabulary. Consider some of the language and early literacy opportunities created during shared reading that are described in Table 1.1. Storybooks increase children�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s familiarity with the sounds and grammar of their language, expose them to the pragmatic rules that govern the use of language, and provide them with models of how stories and narratives are organized in their culture. At the same time, storybooks teach children fundamental knowledge about how books themselves work and how print is organized, and they provide children with repeated exposure to the alphabet and the way in which letters and sounds map on to one another in an alphabetic language. Not the least important, storybook-reading experiences also provide children with opportunities to build relationships with the adults in their lives. It is within the context of children�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s relationships with adults that children�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s developing competencies about language and literacy may emerge (Pianta, 2000).</p><p>With all of the benefits that storybooks offer, it is important to understand that book sharing is not intended to teach children to read. If reading could be taught so easily, nearly all children would be reading by the time they enter school. Instead, book sharing helps children develop a foundation for learning to read. It is not unlike the foundation that children acquire when they listen to music. Listening builds musical skills and knowledge such as becoming aware of pitch and melody, associating sounds with particular instruments (e.g., piano, violin, drum), recognizing that musical notes can be distinguished from one another and can have different meanings, and being able to repeat a tune or sing a song. However, for nearly all children, learning to read music will require explicit instruction. The same is true for learning to read. Consider next some of the research evidence that describes the influence that shared reading has on developing children�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s foundation skills.</p><p><b>Research on Reading Storybooks with Young Children</b></p><p>Hundreds of studies have appeared in scientific journals during the last several decades on how shared reading contributes to the early language and literacy development of young children. This body of research also has reported on how adults can capitalize on these reading interactions to maximize children�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s early achievements. Some of the research that provided the impetus for this book has been selected for review in this section and has been organized to consider three major topics:</p><ol><li>Key findings regarding language and emergent literacy </li><li>How young children�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s early shared-reading experiences vary widely </li><li>Why the quality of shared reading is important </li></ol><p><b>Key Findings Regarding Language and Emergent Literacy</b></p><p>Research has shown that shared reading with young children may affect several aspects of their language and literacy development. With regard to language skills, the dialogic reading technique developed by Grover Whitehurst and his colleagues (Whitehurst et al., 1988) has demonstrated consistent success in increasing children�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s language skills. Dialogic reading involves gradually shifting the storytelling role from the adult reader to the child through various techniques (e.g., open-ended questions, repetition, modeling). Several studies using the dialogic reading technique during shared reading have shown an increase in children�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s oral language skills (Arnold, Lonigan, Whitehurst, &amp; Epstein, 1994; Lonigan &amp; Whitehurst, 1998; Valdez-Menchaca &amp; Whitehurst, 1992; Whitehurst, Arnold, et al., 1994; Whitehurst et al., 1988).</p><p>A unique aspect of storybooks is how they offer an opportunity to decontextualize language. This means that the events and concepts in storybooks are not restricted to the here and now. Rather, the events may reflect actions, events, and ideas that exist beyond the present &#x2014; potentially in the past, in the future, or in another world altogether. The events may flow over time (�&#x20ac;&#x153;Once upon a time . . . �&#x20ac;&#x153;) or they may follow a causal chain of events (as in <i>If You Give a Moose a Muffin</i> by Laura Numeroff). The events may be placed in the past (�&#x20ac;&#x153;There was an old lady . . . �&#x20ac;&#x153;), in the future (�&#x20ac;&#x153;When I grow up . . . �&#x20ac;&#x153;), and even on another planet (�&#x20ac;&#x153;Far away, in another galaxy . . . �&#x20ac;&#x153;). It is through storybooks that children can experience the eventful forays of a mischievous dog as he discovers chicken coops, ponds, and gardens in <i>Spot�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s First Walk</i> by Eric Hill (1981). These experiences go beyond the incidental language and literacy experiences characteristic of the immediate world of young children; they also prepare them for the decontextualized demands that will pervade elementary schooling.</p></p><h2>John Singer Sargent: Figures and Landscapes, 1914-1925: The Complete Paintings, Volume IX</h2><p><b>The final volume in a full survey of the work of John Singer Sargent, covering his late watercolors, designs for the Boston murals, and work as an official War Artist</b><br><br> The last in a series of books devoted to the work of John Singer Sargent (1856&#x2013;1925), this volume covers the figure and landscape works that Sargent produced between 1914 and 1925. The story begins with the artist painting with friends on vacation in Austria in the summer of 1914, unaware that war was about to be declared. The following year, he began working in London on his ideas for the murals at the Boston Public Library and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, before spending two years in Boston and exploring other parts of America. While in Florida to paint a portrait of John D. Rockefeller, he produced a group of uniquely Floridian watercolors that are breathtaking arrangements of color, form, and light. In July 1918 he accepted an invitation from the British government to travel to the Somme battlefields as an official war artist. This experience led him to produce a remarkable group of works depicting troop movements, off-duty soldiers relaxing, and the studies for his epic canvas, <i>Gassed</i>. Sargent returned to Boston in 1921 and 1922 to complete his mural projects, and visits to Maine and New Hampshire yielded numerous watercolors. Chapters on Sargent&#x2019;s materials and the framing of his pictures complete this remarkable project.</p><p>The final volume in a remarkable project to catalogue the complete works of John Singer Sargent, this book covers his late watercolours, designs for the Boston murals, and work as an official War Artist.<br><b>Richard Ormond</b> is an independent art historian and the great-nephew of John Singer Sargent.&nbsp;<b>Elaine Kilmurray</b> is research director of the John Singer Sargent Catalogue Raisonn� Project.<br><br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Vicomte de Bragelonne (Folio (Gallimard)) (French Edition)</h2><p>This historic book may have numerous typos and missing text.

I will take him away. The navy offers a superb future, my friend.&#34; Raoul smiled again so sadly that this time Athos was wounded to the heart, and replied to him by a severe look. Raoul comprehended it all; he recovered his calmness, and was so guarded that not another word escaped him. The duke at length rose, on observing the advanced hour, and said with much animation, &#34; I am in great haste, but if I am told I have lost time in talking with a friend, I will reply that I have gained a good recruit.&#34; &#34;Pardon me, Monsieur the Duke,&#34; interrupted Raoul, &#34;do not tell the king so, for it is not the king I will serve.&#34; &#34;Eh, my friend, whom then will you serve? The times are past when you might have said, &#39;I belong to M. de Beaufort.&#39; No, nowadays, we all belong to the king, great or small. Therefore, if you serve on board my vessels, there can be nothing equivocal in it, my dear viscount; it will be the king you will serve.&#34; Athos waited with a kind of impatient joy for the reply about to be made to this embarrassing question by Raoul, the intractable enemy of the king, his rival. The father hoped that the obstacle would overcome the desire. He was thankful to M. de Beaufort, whose lightness or generous reflection had thrown an impediment in the way of the departure of a son now his only joy. Raoul, still firm and trauquil, replied, &#34;Monsieur the Duke, the objection you make I have already considered in my mind.

Drawing on extensive research in newly opened archives, Steinacher not only reveals how Nazi war criminals escaped from justice at the end of the Second World War, fleeing through the Tyrolean Alps to Italian seaports, but he also highlights the key roles played by the Red Cross, the Vatican, and the Secret Services of the major powers. The book takes a hard look at the International Committee of the Red Cross, proving that identification papers issued by the Red Cross made it possible for thousands of Nazis, war criminals, and collaborators--including Adolf Eichmann and Josef Mengale--to slip through the hands of justice and to find refuge in North and South America, Spain, and the Near East. Steinacher underscores the importance of the South Tyrol as a "ratline" from Germany to Italy and also reveals that many leaders of the Catholic Church--sometimes knowingly, other times unwittingly--were involved in large-scale Nazi smuggling, often driven by the fear of an imminent communist takeover of Italy. Finally, the book documents how the Counter Intelligence Corps (the predecessor to the CIA) recruited former SS men to advise U.S. intelligence agencies and smuggled them out of Soviet-occupied areas of Austria and Eastern Europe into Italy and on to South America.<br></p><p><br><strong>Gerald Steinacher</strong> is currently a Joseph A.

In this lively and readable survey, Jean Hampton has created a text for our time that does justice both to the great traditions of the field and to the newest developments. In a marvelous feat of synthesis, she links the classical tradition, the giants of the modern period, the dominant topics of the twentieth century, and the new questions and concerns that are just beginning to rewrite contemporary political philosophy.Hampton presents these traditions in an engaging and accessible manner, adding to them her own views and encouraging readers to critically examine a range of ideas and to reach their own conclusions. Of particular interest are the discussions of the contemporary liberalism-communitarianism debates, the revival of interest in issues of citizenship and nationality, and the way in which feminist concerns are integrated into all these discussions.<i>Political Philosophy</i> is the most modern text on the topic now available, the ideal guide to what is going on in the field. It will be welcomed by scholars and students in philosophy and political science, and it will serve as an introduction for readers from outside these fields.</p><p>The late <b>Jean Hampton</b> was professor of philosophy at the University of Arizona and the author of <i>Hobbes and the Social Contract Tradition</i> and many articles on moral and political theory.</p><h2>Learning to Teach</h2><p>This best-selling text provides comprehensive coverage of general teaching methods and models.

In reality, the major tropical rain forest regions, in tropical America, Africa, Southeast Asia, Madagascar, and New Guinea, have as many differences as similarities, as a result of their isolation from each other during the evolution of their floras and faunas. This new edition reinforces this message with new examples from recent and on-going research. <p>After an introduction to the environments and geological histories of the major rain forest regions, subsequent chapters focus on plants, primates, carnivores and plant-eaters, birds, fruit bats and gliding animals, and insects, with an emphasis on the ecological and biogeographical differences between regions. This is followed by a new chapter on the unique tropical rain forests of oceanic islands. The final chapter, which has been completely rewritten, deals with the impacts of people on tropical rain forests and discusses possible conservation strategies that take into account the differences highlighted in the previous chapters. This exciting and very readable book, illustrated throughout with color photographs, will be invaluable reading for undergraduate students in a wide range of courses as well as an authoritative reference for graduate and professional ecologists, conservationists, and interested amateurs.</p></p><p><b>Richard Corlett</b>, a Professor at the National University of Singapore, has studied tropical rain forests in New Guinea, Southeast Asia, and southern China.

The book starts off at the beginning laying out Web browser functions some Web users might be less familiar with. It then lays the groundwork of how search engines locate and retrieve the information we re searching for before it moves on to discuss more sophisticated search techniques and then how to apply those techniques to other Web sites to locate the information we re looking for. <p> Because the vast majority of sites discussed in this book are freely available on the Internet, many of these resources could be located through Web searches if you had the time to conduct those searches, sift through all of the results, and test out the sites until you had culled down the millions of potential sites to a list of the most credible, relevant, and useful. That s where the authors of this book come into play: we ve done the test searching and sifting for you so now you can learn about the most credible, relevant, and useful sites and how to quickly master them. </p><p> The newly updated 14th edition of the "Cybersleuth's Guide to the Internet" features Internet investigative search strategies and tips. </p><p> This new edition includes a broader review of ways researchers can use the information posted in Social Networking profiles as a powerful investigative research tool and source of background information. </p><p> It also includes more detailed recommendations for locating and using free public records, investigative research sites, and people finder resources available for free on the Internet, as well as low-cost pay services, such as TLO available to select readers. </p><p> "The Cybersleuth s Guide to the Internet" is a reference book; it is not meant to be read cover to cover.

In this beautiful new book, Paul Hayes Tucker provides a fresh context for these heralded canvases. Drawing on a wide array of sources, from popular broadsides to political speeches, Tucker proposes that Monet&#x2019;s series paintings were not only an artistic response to the beauties of nature but were also related to contemporary events in France and to Monet&#x2019;s determination to provide active leadership for his nation&#x2019;s artistic production.&nbsp;<br>Monet, who had been accused earlier in his career of disregarding professional decorum and denigrating the aesthetic values that France held dear, was hailed by the end of the 1890s as one of the finest landscape painters of the century and as a great national artist. Tucker examines the circumstances that contributed to this shift in opinion: the changes in Monet&#x2019;s art and in his life, an evolution in public taste, and the maturation of concerns the French had about their country and its place in the world. Tucker looks carefully at the development of Monet&#x2019;s art before the 1890s, analyzing in particular the cultural pressures of the 1880s that caused Monet to turn to serial painting. He then focuses in considerable detail on the major and minor series from the ensuing decade, examining how they were painted, their critical reception, and the meaning they held for Monet and his public.<br>This engrossing study provides new subtlety to the series paintings, showing that their rich, encrusted surfaces, extraordinary light effects, and dazzling repetition of images touched deep aesthetic and nationalistic chords. In addition, as Tucker sets the paintings in this larger historical context, he also is able to give us a fresh perspective on Monet&#x2019;s role in the continuities and contradictions of fin-de-si�cle French culture.<br>Publication of this book coincides with an exhibition of Monet&#x2019;s series paintings of the 1890s. The exhibition will open in Boston in February 1990 and will move to Chicago in May and London in September.<br>Paul Hayes Tucker, associate professor of art at the University of Massachusetts in Boston, is also the author of <i>Monet at Argenteuil</i>.</p><p></p><h2>Teleny: A Novel Attributed to Oscar Wilde</h2><p>The prose of this homosexual love story recounts the progress of the obsessive passion felt by Camille Des Grieux for Rene Teleny.

The visions of law and peace between different peoples that emerged out of the Encounter era are represented in the hundreds of treaties and agreements Indians and whites negotiated with each other. Extraordinary documents in their own right, the treaty records of this intense and crisis-filled era reflect a variety of American Indian approaches to the problems of achieving law and peace between different peoples. Williams&#39;s examination of the treaty literature of the Encounter era helps us recall a long-neglected period of our national experience when Indians tried to create a new type of society with the white man on the multi-cultural frontiers of North America. Williams maintains that recovering a deeper understanding of this shared legal world of the North American Encounter era is crucial to the task of protecting Indian rights under U.S. law. Just as important, a better understanding of American Indian treaty visions of law and peace can also help us begin to imagine how U.S. law may achieve racial justice more generally.<strong>Robert A.

Annie Proulx&#39;s novel The Shipping News recieved the Irish Times International Fiction Prize, the National Book Award, and the Pulitzer Prize. er other books include Heart Songs and Other Stories, Post Cards, and The Accordian Crimes. She currently lives in Wyoming.Over 80 years old, this admirable series might consider a new rule: No stories included that will appear in book form before the "best" volume does. The latest entry features quite a few already reviewed by Kirkus as parts of story collections (Lydia Davis, Junot D�az, Tobias Wolff, Tim Gautreaux, etc.) and even novels (by Cynthia Ozick and Clyde Edgerton). That caveat aside, Proulx selects stories from almost all major venues, which makes series editor Kenison's ramblings about on-line mags, none represented, a bit silly. Combative and feisty, Proulx clearly prefers more conventional narrative forms, though the subjects here are free-ranging. Standouts include Jonathan Franzen's ``Chez Lambert,'' a deft piece about an elderly couple and their daily lives in retirement. Equally textured and subtle is Jeffrey Eugenides's ``Air Mail,'' a chronicle of its narrator's post-collegiate Wanderjahr, which takes him to the East and an apparent experience of spiritual ecstasy. Heavily determined by place are Pam Durban's southern family tale ``Soon,'' about the legacies of tough-minded women; Donald Hall's anti-nostalgic ``From Willow Temple,'' spanning the century in Michigan and revealing the secret passions of some unforgiving people; and Alison Hagy's ``Search Bay,'' set on Michigan's Upper Peninsula and neatly reflecting the harsh life of its central figure, a retired seaman who lives alone. Richard Bausch defines the humor here with his hilarious ``Nobody in Hollywood,'' about two wayward brothers and the difficult women they encounter. Karen E. Bender's ``Eternal Love'' provides a touching counterpoint with its tale of two retarded adults getting married. Michelle Cliff and T.C. Boyle, both writers with heavy hands, consider the ironies of race and colonialism (Cliff) and the pro-life movement (Boyle). All in all, a strong sampling of what the major magazines (the New Yorker, Paris Review, GQ, etc.) are publishing these days. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He describes two concepts of evolution the biological and the historical and argues that we must go beyond the mechanism of mutation in order to understand our origins. Beautifully conceived and executed, but Portmann, in his desire to define the particularly &#34;human&#34;, implicitly and unjustly diminishes the uniqueness and complexity of other animal species.

Like other species, we have a culture. But by comparison with other species, we are strangely unstable: human cultures self-transform, diverge, and multiply with bewildering speed. They vary, radically and rapidly, from time to time and place to place. And the way we live--our manners, morals, habits, experiences, relationships, technology, values--seems to be changing at an ever accelerating pace. The effects can be dislocating, baffling, sometimes terrifying. Why is this? <br><br>In <em>A Foot in the River</em>, best-selling historian Felipe Fernandez-Armesto sifts through the evidence and offers some radical answers to these very big questions about the human species and its history--and speculates on what these answers might mean for our future. Combining insights from a huge range of disciplines, including history, biology, anthropology, archaeology, philosophy, sociology, ethology, zoology, primatology, psychology, linguistics, the cognitive sciences, and even business studies, he argues that culture is exempt from evolution. Ultimately, no environmental conditions, no genetic legacy, no predictable patterns, no scientific laws determine our behaviour. We can consequently make and remake our world in the freedom of unconstrained imaginations. <br><br>A revolutionary book which challenges scientistic assumptions about culture and how and why cultural change happens, <em>A Foot in the River</em> comes to conclusions which readers may well find by turns both daunting and also potentially hugely liberating.<br></p><p><br><strong>Felipe Fernandez-Armesto</strong> is the William P.

Just a few years earlier, some had been slaves. Several thousand African Americans served as soldiers in the Indian Wars and in the Cuban campaign of the Spanish-American War in the latter part of the nineteenth century. They were known as buffalo soldiers, believed to have been named by Indians who had seen a similarity between the coarse hair and dark skin of the soldiers and the coats of the buffalo. Twenty-three of these men won the nation's highest award for personal bravery, the Medal of Honor. Black Valor brings the lives of these soldiers into sharp focus. Their remarkable stories are told in the collected biography. Derived from extensive historical research, Black Valor will enrich and inspire students with its tales of trials and courage.<br></p><p>Frank N. Schubert is the author and editor of four books on buffalo soldiers. He retired in 2003 after twenty-seven years as a historian in the U.S. Department of Defense.<br>Department of Defense historian Schubert (On the Trail of the Buffalo Soldier, LJ 11/1/94) offers here accounts of African Americans who won the Congrepssional Medal of Honor during the Indian wars and the Spanish American War. His work contains elements both of collective biography and of unit histories of the various campaigns for which the soldiers were decorated. Although this volume clearly evidences meticulous research, the sources available on the men themselves are too sketchy for satisfying reading. The book is organized by campaign, and the accounts of movements and battles are easier to follow, but even here, the narrative frequently halts to introduce the soldiers and describe the actions that won recognition. The work would have been more helpful had it been issued as a reference title.

The novel is the outcome of reflection on Gothic horror, galvanism, the then theories concerning the origin of life and the myth of Prometheus.</p><p><i>Frankenstein,</i> loved by many decades of readers and praised by such eminent literary critics as Harold Bloom, seems hardly to need a recommendation. If you haven't read it recently, though, you may not remember the sweeping force of the prose, the grotesque, surreal imagery, and the multilayered <i>doppelg�nger</i> themes of Mary Shelley's masterpiece. As fantasy writer Jane Yolen writes of this (the reviewer's favorite) edition, "The strong black and whites of the main text [illustrations] are dark and brooding, with unremitting shadows and stark contrasts. But the central conversation with the monster--who owes nothing to the overused movie image but is rather the novel's charnel-house composite--is where [Barry] Moser's illustrations show their greatest power ... The viewer can all but smell the powerful stench of the monster's breath as its words spill out across the page. Strong book-making for one of the world's strongest and most remarkable books."

He describes the day-to-day experiences of dozens of men and women, and in the process illuminates the social dimensions of this profound, far-reaching transformation. Brown begins in Massachusetts and Virginia in the early 18th century, when public information was the precious possession of the wealthy, learned, and powerful, who used it to reinforce political order and cultural unity. Employing diaries and letters to trace how information moved through society during seven generations, he explains that by the Civil War era, cultural unity had become a thing of the past. Assisted by advanced technology and an expanding economy, Americans had created a pluralistic information marketplace in which all forms of public communication--print, oratory, and public meetings--were competing for the attention of free men and women. <em>Knowledge is Power</em> provides fresh insights into the foundations of American pluralism and deepens our perspective on the character of public communications in the United States.<br></p><p>Richard D.

As we read this book we learn, among other things, what people read, why they wrote letters, to whom they spoke and why, what newspapers meant to them, and how they regarded public discourse.

Gross, The College of William and Mary<p></p><br>"Richard D. Brown's <em>Knowledge Is Power</em> is an excellent study of the social function of news, information, and knowledge from the late seventeenth century to 1950. By ingeniously linking diffusion to knowledge and flows of information to geographical setting, public position and social status of men and women, free and slave, we learn not only why people reacted so differently to political, economic, and other events but understand why individualism, choice, communalism, and competition are key concepts for explaining the transformation of early colonial societies into the mature republication society of mid-nineteenth-century America....This study not only offers a new and highly stimulating interpretation of colonial society, but a fresh and exciting new perspective on the age old question of the importance of the American Revolution for the emerging Republic."--Hermann Wellenreuther, Georg-August University, Gottingen, West Germany<p></p><br>"Highly innovative....A superb example of the new cultural and political history, a modernized 'histoire des mentalites.'"--Elise Marienstras, University of Paris 7<p></p><br>"Truly a valuable study....The research for this book is quite impressive....Insightful and penetrating....His writing style is creative....Brown has dared to be a pioneer, and he should be commended for a highly successful effort."--<em>Social Science Quarterly</em><p></p><br>"No other study provides us with such a clear view of the ways in which culture and mentality were constructed from the nuts and bolts or oral, written, and printed communication."--<em>Reviews in American History</em><p></p><br>"This exhilarating, swift-moving volume offers nothing less than a new way of looking at American history....This superb book can be enjoyed by the general reader and by college classes in its attractive paperback format."--<em>Historical Journal of Massachusetts</em><p></p><br>"Richard Brown makes clear in this insightful book that the mere development of information technology did not lead to an information explosion....'Society is held together by communication and information,' Samuel Johnson wrote in the 1770s in a passage quoted by Brown. <em>Knowledge is Power</em> shows us the importance of this assertion, and thus allows us to recognize the historical origins of our information revolution."--<em>American Studies</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Pre-Feeding Skills: A Comprehensive Resources for Mealtime Development</h2><p>This essential resource, now updated and expanded for mealtime and feeding development This newly revised and referenced edition, by the authors of the best-selling Pre-Feeding Skills, is a must for pediatric feeding specialists working with clients from birth to adolescence.

Robert Jordan, a young American volunteer, has been sent to handle the dynamiting. There, in the mountains, he finds the dangers and the intense comradeship of war. And there he discovers Maria, a young woman who has escaped from Franco&#39;s rebels...</p><p><i>For Whom the Bell Tolls</i> begins and ends in a pine-scented forest, somewhere in Spain. The year is 1937 and the Spanish Civil War is in full swing. Robert Jordan, a demolitions expert attached to the International Brigades, lies "flat on the brown, pine-needled floor of the forest, his chin on his folded arms, and high overhead the wind blew in the tops of the pine trees." The sylvan setting, however, is at sharp odds with the reason Jordan is there: he has come to blow up a bridge on behalf of the antifascist guerrilla forces. He hopes he'll be able to rely on their local leader, Pablo, to help carry out the mission, but upon meeting him, Jordan has his doubts: "I don't like that sadness, he thought. That sadness is bad. That's the sadness they get before they quit or before they betray. That is the sadness that comes before the sell-out." For Pablo, it seems, has had enough of the war. He has amassed for himself a small herd of horses and wants only to stay quietly in the hills and attract as little attention as possible. Jordan's arrival--and his mission--have seriously alarmed him. <blockquote> "I am tired of being hunted. Here we are all right. Now if you blow a bridge here, we will be hunted. If they know we are here and hunt for us with planes, they will find us. If they send Moors to hunt us out, they will find us and we must go. I am tired of all this. You hear?" He turned to Robert Jordan. "What right have you, a foreigner, to come to me and tell me what I must do?" </blockquote> In one short chapter Hemingway lays out the blueprint for what is to come: Jordan's sense of duty versus Pablo's dangerous self-interest and weariness with the war. Complicating matters even more are two members of the guerrilla leader's small band: his "woman" Pilar, and Maria, a young woman whom Pablo rescued from a Republican prison train. Unlike her man, Pilar is still fiercely devoted to the cause and as Pablo's loyalty wanes, she becomes the moral center of the group. Soon Jordan finds himself caught between the two, even as his own resolve is tested by his growing feelings for Maria. <p> <i>For Whom the Bell Tolls</i> combines two of the author's recurring obsessions: war and personal honor. The pivotal battle scene involving El Sordo's last stand is a showcase for Hemingway's narrative powers, but the quieter, ongoing conflict within Robert Jordan as he struggles to fulfill his mission perhaps at the cost of his own life is a testament to his creator's psychological acuity. By turns brutal and compassionate, it is arguably Hemingway's most mature work and one of the best war novels of the 20th century. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>11 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Mechanics, 2nd Edition</h2><p>Mechanics Second Edition P.

Rather than an unpleasant phase to be endured or alleviated, Marian Van Eyk McCain views menopause as an empowering experience that women can use for personal growth. Artfully interweaving her research, years of clinical experience, and her personal perceptions of menopause to create an inspiring new vision of the change of life. She goes well beyond a discussion of hormones and hot flashes to uncover the deep emotional and spiritual significance of this time in women's lives.</p><p></p><p>This book is not only about change on a personal or physical level but in society as well. McCain lays out historical and cross-cultural beliefs about menstruation and menopause and the attitudes surrounding them (from taboos to reverence) and points out that in our modern society women most often either try to ignore or make it through this essential period of womanhood in order to compete in a man's world on male terms. In tune with recent feminist thought, the author says there is a new womanpower emerging, which means that it is time for women to honor their natural cycles. There is no other book that combines the insights, inspiration, and wealth of information contained in this work. It is an important book for the alternative-minded baby-boom generation who are seeking new ways to approach middle age.</p></p><p><p>offers women a holistic framework for understanding this physiological process as a rite of passage and using it to create positive change in their lives. . . . an excellent addition to the women's health collection of all libraries. <i>Library Journal</i></p>The first holistic perspective on menopause, this book explores how the &#34;change of life&#34; can empower women. Drawing from years of research and clinical work, McCain sees more in menopause than the sum of its psychological and emotional parts: the change is a rite of passage, a prime opportunity for emotional and spiritual growth. McCain explains how Western metaphors for growth are linear, and, by using Eastern concepts of circularity and reflecting upon the real experience of women, she paints a truly alternative picture.</p><h2>Color Atlas of Biochemistry</h2><p><p> Totally revised and expanded, <i>Color Atlas of Biochemistry</i> presents the fundamentals of human and mammalian biochemistry on 215 stunning color plates.</p><p>Alongside a short introduction to chemistry and the classical topics of biochemistry, the second edition covers new approaches and aspects in biochemistry, such as links between chemical structure and biological function or pathways for information transfer, as well as recent developments and discoveries, such as the structures of many new important molecules.</p><p> Key features include:</p> <ul><li> The unique combination of highly effective color graphics and comprehensive figure legends</li><li> Unified color-coding of atoms, coenzymes, chemical classes, and cell organelles that allows quick recognition of all involved systems</li><li> Computer graphics provide simulated 3D representation of many important molecules</li></ul><p> This Flexibook is ideal for students of medicine and biochemistry and a valuable source of reference for practitioners.</p></p><p>Professor, Institute of Physiologic Chemistry, Philipps University, Marburg, GermanyText: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>The Adventures of Sally</h2><p>In a story set on both sides of the Atlantic, life was always simple for Sally Nicholas until she inherits a fortune.

While adults try to decipher Lewis Carroll's putative use of complex mathematical codes in the text, or debate his alleged use of opium, young readers simply dive with Alice through the rabbit hole, pursuing "The dream-child moving through a land / Of wonders wild and new." There they encounter the White Rabbit, the Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, and the Mad Hatter, among a multitude of other characters--extinct, fantastical, and commonplace creatures. Alice journeys through this Wonderland, trying to fathom the meaning of her strange experiences. But they turn out to be "curiouser and curiouser," seemingly without moral or sense.<p> For more than 130 years, children have reveled in the delightfully <i>non</i>-moralistic, <i>non</i>-educational virtues of this classic. In fact, at every turn, Alice's new companions scoff at her traditional education. The Mock Turtle, for example, remarks that he took the "regular course" in school: Reeling, Writhing, and branches of Arithmetic-Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision. Carroll believed John Tenniel's illustrations were as important as his text. Naturally, Carroll's instincts were good; the masterful drawings are inextricably tied to the well-loved story.

She teaches methods classes for perspective teachers and graduate reading courses and conducts classroom-based research in local elementary schools. Shira Lubliner's research interests focus on methods of vocabulary instruction that imporvoe children's reading comprehension achievement. She designed a comprehensive program of vocabulary development, on which this book is based, that can be implemented by classroom teachers using regular instructional materials. Results from a recent study she conducted in one of California's lowest performing Title I schools documented large gains in vocabulary and reading comprehension and a narrowing of the achievement gap between Title I students and those in an above-average school following the implementation of this comprehensive vocabulary development program (Lubliner &amp; Smetana, 2004, manuscript submitted for publication). Dr. Lubliner presents workshops for teachers on vocabulary instruction and reading comprehension throughout the United States and is often a speaker at the annual meetings of the American Educational Research Association, the International Reading Association, the National Council for the Social Studies, and the California Reading Association.

Project: Reinventing Education, Reinventing the Human</h2><p>Matthew Fox has done it again. As one of the most prophetic voices of our time, he has created a unique new project that speaks the concerns and hopes of all of us who care about creating lives of meaning - for ourselves, our communities, our children and our children's children... <i>The A.W.E. Project</i> reminds us that awe is the appropriate response to the unfathomable wonder that is creation - from the magnificence of galaxies, to the complex and brilliant process of cell-differentiation, and the miracle of the humanhand (product of 14 billion years of evolution). Imagine how much richer learning will be for all ages when we intentionally cultivate a sense of appreciation and wonder. A.W.E. is also the acronym for Fox's proposed style of learning - an approach to balance the three R's. This approach to learning, eldering, and mentoring is intelligent enough to honor the teachings of the Ancestors, to nurture Wisdom in addition to imparting knowledge, and to Educate through Fox's 10 C's. The 10 C's are the core of the A.W.E. philosophy and process of education, and include: compassion, contemplation, and creativity. <i>The A.W.E. Project </i> does for the vast subject of "learning" what Fox's Reinvention of Work did for vocation and Original Blessing did for theology. With passion and conviction, Fox turns conventional "education" upside down, shakes out what is no longer working, and offers visions of what can be.</p><p><p>Matthew Fox is the author of 27 books including <i>The Coming of the Cosmic Christ, Sheer Joy: Conversations with Thomas Aquinas on Creation Spirituality, A New Reformation, Natural Grace</i> (with Biochemist Rupert Sheldrake), and<i> Creativity: Where the Divine and the Human Meet.</i>. He is in demand around the world as a speaker, leader, and reformer. For 30 years Matthew Fox has been at the cutting edge of creative and meaningful education for adult learners. This book distills Matthew Fox's pedagogy and experience he has learned from those very successful programs and applies it to children and learners of all ages.</p></p><h2>Pre-Calculus Problem Solver (Problem Solvers Solution Guides)</h2><p><b>REA&#x2019;s<i> Pre-Calculus Problem Solver </i></b><br><br>Each <i>Problem Solver</i> is an insightful and essential study and solution guide chock-full of clear, concise problem-solving gems.

King and Leslie S. Klinger present a brand-new anthology of stories inspired by the Arthur Conan Doyle canon.</strong></p> In this follow-up to the acclaimed <em>In the Company of Sherlock Holmes</em>, expert Sherlockians Laurie King and Les Klinger put forth the question: What happens when great writers/creators who are not known as Sherlock Holmes devotees admit to being inspired by Conan Doyle stories? While some are highly-regarded mystery writers, others are best known for their work in the fields of fantasy or science fiction. All of these talented authors, however, share a great admiration for Arthur Conan Doyle and his greatest creations, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.<br><br> To the editors&#x2019; great delight, these stories go in many directions. Some explore the spirit of Holmes himself; others tell of detectives themselves inspired by Holmes&#x2019;s adventures or methods. A young boy becomes a detective; a young woman sharpens her investigative skills; an aging actress and a housemaid each find that they have unexpected talents. Other characters from the Holmes stories are explored, and even non-Holmesian tales by Conan Doyle are echoed. The variations are endless!<br><br> Although not a formal collection of new Sherlock Holmes stories&#x2015;however some do fit that mold&#x2015;instead these writers were asked to be inspired by the Conan Doyle canon. The results are breathtaking, for fans of Holmes and Watson as well as readers new to Doyle&#x2019;s writing&#x2015;indeed, for all readers who love exceptional storytelling.</p><p><p><strong>Laurie R. King</strong> is the <em>New York Times&nbsp;</em>bestselling author of numerous books, including the Mary Russell-Sherlock Holmes stories. She has won or been nominated for a multitude of prizes, has been chosen as the guest of honor at several crime conventions, and is probably the only writer to have both an Edgar Award and an honorary doctorate in theology. She was inducted into the Baker Street Irregulars in 2010.</p><p><strong>Leslie S. Klinger</strong>&nbsp;is one of the world&#x2019;s foremost authorities on Sherlock Holmes.

He is also the editor of the hugely&nbsp;successful&nbsp;<em>The New&nbsp;Annotated H. P. Lovecraft</em>.&nbsp;Klinger is a member of the Baker Street Irregulars and lives in Malibu, California.</p>&#x201c;If you are a fan of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's consulting detective series, you owe it to yourself to read this collection. I found myself laughing with delight, and turning pages with trembling fingers, driven to see what came next as each new author spun a tale related, in some way, to Conan Doyle's immortal characters.

(Monographs in Population Biology, No. 23)</h2><p><p>"Ecosystem" is an intuitively appealing concept to most ecologists, but, in spite of its widespread use, the term remains diffuse and ambiguous. The authors of this book argue that previous attempts to define the concept have been derived from particular viewpoints to the exclusion of others equally possible.

Their contribution should help to counteract the present separation of subdisciplines in ecology and to bring functional and population/community ecologists closer to a common approach.</p><br><p> Developed as a way of understanding highly complex organized systems, hierarchy theory has at its center the idea that organization results from differences in process rates. To the authors the theory suggests an objective way of decomposing ecosystems into their component parts. The results thus obtained offer a rewarding method for integrating various schools of ecology.</p></p><p></p><h2>Knut Hamsun: Dreamer &amp; Dissenter</h2><p><p><b>An absorbing biography of Nobel Prize&#x2013;winning novelist Knut Hamsun, based on a wealth of previously unavailable sources</b><br><br> Norwegian writer Knut Hamsun (1859&#x2013;1952), winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1920, was a man both brilliant and controversial. Lauded for his literary achievements by Hemingway, Gide, Hesse, and others, he also provoked outrage for his open collaboration with the Fascists during the German occupation of Norway and for his insistent refusal to renounce his Nazi sympathies.</p><p>This gripping biography of Hamsun, now available for the first time in English, offers a nuanced account of this morally ambiguous man. Drawing on Hamsun&#x2019;s extraordinary private archives and on his psychoanalyst&#x2019;s notes, Ingar Sletten Kolloen delves deeply into Hamsun&#x2019;s personal life and character. In vivid and telling detail, he describes Hamsun&#x2019;s early years in a peasant farming family, his tempestuous and jealousy-racked second marriage, his erratic relationship with his children, and his infamous love affair with Nazi Germany, the roots of which Kolloen traces to Hamsun&#x2019;s earliest days.&nbsp; Much like the characters he created in novels such as <i>Hunger, Growth of the Soil, Mysteries</i><i>,</i> and <i>Pan</i><i>,</i> Hamsun was irrational, eccentric, strange, and compelling&#x2014;a man uncomfortable in his own time.</p></p><p><p>Ingar Sletten Kolloen won the Norwegian Readers&#x2019; Award 2004 for this biography. He has worked as publisher, journalist, commentator, and editor for a number of newspapers. He lives in Norway.</p>The second best-known modern Norwegian writer after Ibsen&#x2014;who remained a lifelong bugbear&#x2014;Knut Hamsun (1859&#x2013;1952) is an author of immense psychological insight and massive personal contradictions: surely one of the most controversial winners of the Nobel Prize for Literature. This somewhat rigid biography by a Norwegian journalist and editor gets to the heart of the last word of its subtitle early and often. Growing up in poverty that left the seeds for a giant inferiority complex, strong anti-British sentiments and a more moderate dislike for the United States, Hamsun was a restless obstreperous, Nietzschean and an often alienating husband and father (though he remained married to the same woman&#x2014;a much-younger actress, later a writer of children's and poetry books&#x2014;for more than 40 years). Hamsun's reputation is tarnished by his embrace of Nazi ideology. Yet, in not untypical fashion, his outlandish meeting with Hitler left the Nazi leader quaking. Praised by the likes of Henry Miller, Thomas Mann and Isaac Bashevis Singer, Knut Hamsun is given his due, although at something of an academic distance, in this unsentimental portrait. 20 b&amp;w illus. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Now, archaeologist Susan Redford investigates the circumstances of the ancient pharaoh's death and discovers among the women of his harem the threads of a murder conspiracy. <br> <br>From new translations of ancient papyri and careful readings of temple carvings, Redford identifies the suspects in the assassination&#x2014;wives, concubines, and attendants. She evaluates the evidence against them and outlines a possible murder plot that turns upon a shocking revelation about the pharaoh's immediate family. On the basis of new discoveries relating to the identity of Ramesses III's queens and their sons, she uncovers a primary motive for regicide and presents persuasive evidence of a palace revolt. Divisions between clans and rival lineages, she argues, gave rise to a plot to murder the king. <br> <br>Richly illustrated with thirty photos and diagrams, Redford's groundbreaking investigation of the plot to murder "the last of the great pharaohs" offers an extraordinary vision of the ancient Egyptian world.</p></p><p><p>Susan Redford, a research affiliate of Pennsylvania State University, directs the Theban Tomb Survey in the Valley of the Nobles at Luxor.

Later, in Tom Sawyer Detective (1896), Twain returns us the banks of the Mississippi and a murder mystery involving identical twins and stolen diamonds. The author is back in his formative territory, the region his imagination could never leave behind.

The film&#x2019;s highly stylized sets, choreographed brutality, and Moog synthesizer score&#x2015;conceived to heighten the effect of each scene&#x2015;were so ahead of their time that, to many, they obscured the overall message.

Using research conducted with Harvard undergraduates over a fifteen-year period, Perry derived an Anduring framework for characterizing student development--a scheme so accurate that it still informs and advances investigations into student development across gAnders and cultures.<br><br>Drawing from firsthand accounts, Perry traces a path from students' adolescence into adulthood. His nine-stage model describes the steps that move students from a simplistic, categorical view of knowledge to a more complex, contextual view of the world and of themselves. Throughout this journey of cognitive development, Perry reveals that the most significant changes occur in forms in which people perceive their world rather than in the particulars of their attitudes and concerns. He shows ultimately that the nature of intellectual development is such that we should pay as much attention to the processes we use as to the content.<br><br>In a new introduction to this classic work, Lee Knefelkamp--a close colleague of Perry's and a leading expert on college student development--evaluates the book's place in the literature of higher education. Knefelkamp explains how the Perry scheme has shaped current thinking about student development and discusses the most significant research that has since evolved from Perry's groundbreaking effort.<br><br>Forms of Ethical and Intellectual Development in the College Years is a work that every current and future student services professional must have in their library.</p><p>WILLIAM G.

However, it only became common in northern Europe during the 16th century when it was known as majolica or Delftware as a consequence of the large quantity manufactured in Delft, Holland. Delftware soon became widely used by apothecaries for the storage of powders, ointments, syrups, oils and confections and such drug jars were often highly decorated or labelled to indicate their contents or commemorate events. Manufacture of Delftware drug jars began at certain locations in London in about 1570 until about 1780 by which time tin-glazed earthenware began to be replaced by creamware, the forerunner of our modern white earthenware. English Delftware drug jars were expensive, highly prized objects, and because of their cost largely remained the property of London-based apothecaries. However, in the British Isles, Delftware drug jars were also produced in Liverpool, Glasgow, Dublin and Limerick Today, English Delftware drug jars are highly collectable and rare. Fine examples often sell on the open market for in excess of [pound]10,000. Most of the ceramics are highly decorated with blue-coloured designs. However, multicoloured jars are also known though are very rare. Several museums and individuals hold collections of Delftware drug jars though the collection in the museum of the RPSGB is regarded as the finest in the UK and is of international significance. Until relatively recently, the RPSGB collection had not been fully photographed and catalogued. A comprehensive survey or catalogue of the collection has not previously been published This new title will include an introductory chapter by the Editor, along with a chapter on the history of English Delftware Drug jars by William Jackson a pharmacist historian noted as one of the UK&#39;s leading authorities on drug jars. An additional chapter from archaeologists at the Museum of London will give an overview of Delftware manufacture in London. Since fragments of Delftware are readily identifiable and datable the importance of Delftware in dating archaeological excavations will also be described. These three chapters will be illustrated with 220 individual colour photos of drug jars from the RPSGB collection. Each photograph will be systematically captioned with relevant text describing the drug jar, its manufacture, date, etc.</p><p>Today, English delftware drug jars are rare and extremely collectable.

According to the myth, having seen his father Noah naked, Ham&#39;s is cursed to have his descendants be forever slaves. In this new book the Curse of Ham is explored in its Reformation context, revealing how it became the cornerstone of the Christian defence of slavery and the slave trade for the next four hundred years. It shows how broader medieval interpretations of the story became marginalized in the early modern period as writers such as Annius of Viterbo and George Best began to weave the legend of Ham into their own books, expanding and adding to the legend in ways that established a firm connection between Ham, Africa, slavery and race. For although in the original biblical text Ham himself is not cursed and race is never mentioned, these writers helped develop the story of Ham into an ideological and theological defence for African slavery, at the precise time that the Transatlantic Slave Trade began to establish itself as a major part of the European economy during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Skilfully weaving together elements of theology, literature and history, this book provides a fascinating insight into the ways that issues of religion, economics and race could collide in the Reformation world. It will prove essential reading, not only for those with an interest in early modern history, but for anyone wishing to try to comprehend the origins of arguments used to justify slavery and segregation right up to the 1960s.</p><p>David M.

In <i>Recovered Roots</i>, Yael Zerubavel illuminates this dynamic process by examining the construction of Israeli national tradition.<br> <br> In the years leading to the birth of Israel, Zerubavel shows, Zionist settlers in Palestine consciously sought to rewrite Jewish history by reshaping Jewish memory. Zerubavel focuses on the nationalist reinterpretation of the defense of Masada against the Romans in 73 C.E. and the Bar Kokhba revolt of 133-135; and on the transformation of the 1920 defense of a new Jewish settlement in Tel Hai into a national myth. Zerubavel demonstrates how, in each case, Israeli memory transforms events that ended in death and defeat into heroic myths and symbols of national revival.<br> <br> Drawing on a broad range of official and popular sources and original interviews, Zerubavel shows that the construction of a new national tradition is not necessarily the product of government policy but a creative collaboration between politicans, writers, and educators. Her discussion of the politics of commemoration demonstrates how rival groups can turn the past into an arena of conflict as they posit competing interpretations of history and opposing moral claims on the use of the past. Zerubavel analyzes the emergence of counter-memories within the reality of Israel's frequent wars, the ensuing debates about the future of the occupied territories, and the embattled relations with Palestinians.<br> <br> A fascinating examination of the interplay between history and memory, this book will appeal to historians, sociologists, anthropologists, political scientists, and folklorists, as well as to scholars of cultural studies, literature, and communication.</p></p><p>In Recovered Roots, Yael Zerubavel illuminates this dynamic process by examining the construction of Israeli national tradition and the reshaping of Jewish memory.</p><h2>Fundamentals of Classical Thermodynamics</h2><p>A revision of the best-selling introduction to classical thermodynamics written for undergraduate engineering students.

A huge popular and critical success when it was first published in 1884, <em>Ramona </em>is set among the California Spanish missions and tells the story of the young mixed-blood heroine, Ramona, and her Native American lover Alessandro, as they flee from the brutal violence of white settlers. </p> <p> This Broadview edition re-examines the novel&#x2019;s legacy by placing it alongside public speeches, letters, and newspaper articles that promoted what was ultimately a damaging campaign by reformers to &#x201c;assimilate&#x201d; Native American peoples. Selections from Jackson&#x2019;s non-fiction writings call into question the link between assimilationist policies and the story told in <em>Ramona</em>; also included are the writings and testimonies of some of Jackson&#x2019;s Native American contemporaries, as well as a selection of travel essays and images that helped to create &#x201c;the Ramona myth.&#x201d; </p></p><p>"If I could write a story that would do for the Indian a thousandth part of what "Uncle Tom's Cabin did for the Negro," wrote Helen Hunt Jackson, "I would be thankful the rest of my life." Jackson surpassed this ambition with the publication of "Ramona, her popular 1884 romantic bestseller. <br>A beautiful half Native American, half-Scottish orphan raised by a harsh Mexican "ranchera, Ramona enters into a forbidden love affair with a heroic Mission Indian named Alessandro. The pair's adventures after they elope paint a vivid portrait of California history and the woeful fate of Native Americans and Mexicans whose lands and rights were stripped as Anglo-Americans overran southern California. <br>Set from the first American edition of 1884, this Modern Library Paperback Classic includes Jose Marti's 1888 prologue (translated from the Spanish by Esther Allen).<p> <strong>Siobhan Senier</strong> is Associate Professor of English at the University of New Hampshire. </p></p><h2>Francie &amp; Her Mod, Mod, Mod World of Fashion</h2><p>BARBIE doll&#39;s cousin Francie, who celebrated her 30th anniversary in 1996, is showcased with the hottest &#34;mod&#34; fashions and accessories!

This is the story of the adventures and misadventures of the people of Israel in the land of Egypt the years shrouded in the mists of biblical history under the Pharaohs; the strange intermezzo of the Jewish mercenary detachment on the island of Elephantine on the upper Nile; the apogee of Jewish culture under Ptolemies; and finally, the Jewish community's rapid decline and catastrophic disappearance under Roman rule. Joseph M�l�ze Modrzejewski uses scientific analysis to illuminate the reality underlying our image of the past. The biblical accounts and Jewish and pagan literary texts are juxtaposed with discoveries of a century of archaeological and papyrological research that has unearthed the edicts of emperors as well as the humble correspondence of common people.

The biblical account and Jewish and pagan literary texts are juxtaposed with the discoveries of a century of archaeological and papyrological research that unearthed the edicts of emperors as well as the humble correspondence of common people, inscriptions on shells in Aramaic and on tombstones in Greek. The author comments when necessary but, for the most part, lets the documents speak for themselves.

In the fast-paced <i>Prairie Rose,</i> impulsive nineteen-year-old Rosie Mills takes a job caring for the young son of widowed homesteader Seth Hunter in order to escape the orphanage in which she was raised.

In it, Susan C. Jarratt argues that the first sophists&#x2015;a diverse group of traveling intellectuals in the fifth century B.C.&#x2015;should be given a more prominent place in the study of rhetoric and composition. Rereading the ancient sophists, she creates a new lens through which to see contemporary social issues, including the orality/literacy debate, feminist writing, deconstruction, and writing pedagogy.</p><p>The sophists&#x2019; pleasure in the play of language, their focus on historical contin-gency, and the centrality of their teaching for democratic practice were sufficiently threatening to their successors Plato and Aristotle that both sought to bury the sophists under philosophical theories of language. The censure of Plato and Aris-totle set a pattern for historical views of the sophists for centuries. Following Hegel and Nietzsche, Jarratt breaks the pattern, finding in the sophists a more progressive charter for teachers and scholars of reading and writing, as well as for those in the adjacent disciplines of literary criticism and theory, education, speech communication, and ancient history.</p><p>In tracing the historical interpretations of sophistic rhetoric, Jarratt suggests that the sophists themselves provide the outlines of an alternative to history-writing as the discovery and recounting of a set of stable facts. She sees sophistic use of narrative in argument as a challenge to a simple division between orality and literacy, current discussions of which virtually ignore the sophists. Outlining similarities between <i>�criture f�minine </i>and sophistic style, Jarratt shows that contemporary feminisms have more in common with sophists than just a style; they share a rhetorical basis for deployment of theory in political action. In her final chapter, Jarratt takes issue with accounts of sophistic pedagogy focusing on technique and the development of the individual. She argues that, despite its employment by powerful demagogues, sophistic pedagogy offers a resource for today&#x2019;s teachers interested in encouraging minority voices of resistance through language study as the practice of democracy.</p></p><p><p><b>Susan C<i>.</i> Jarratt</b> is associate professor of English at Miami University and is the recipient of several research awards.</p><p>"<i>Rereading the Sophists</i> is a fine example of new rhetorical history."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>&#x2015;<i>Composition Chronicle</i></b></p><br><br><p>"<i>Rereading the Sophists</i> contributes to our understanding in several ways: new historical insights about the sophists, a new paradigm for viewing our present concerns, and a new openness to how we study rhetoric."<b>&#x2015;<i>Quarterly Journal of Speech</i></b></p><br><br><p>"In attempting to view the sophists from outside the filter of Plato and Aristotle, Jarratt has provided an intriguing reinterpretation of an important movement in the history of classical rhetoric. . . . Because of the questions it may raise, this is an important book that does an admirable job of interpreting the sophists from the perspective of the Dialectical School."<b>&#x2015;<i>Southern Communications Journal </i></b></p><p>"This perspective is both dynamic and refreshing. Jarratt's most important contributions and her most valuable pages have to do with the history of the evaluation of the sophists and her attempts to delineate just how they may serve as exemplary figures today."<b>&#x2015;<i>Ancient Philosophy </i></b></p><p><b><i></i></b>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>"Jarratt's reexamination of sophistic history and its application to contemporary concerns succeeds in provoking thought along some important new lines."<b>&#x2015;<i>Philosophy and Rhetoric </i></b></p></p><h2>Port of Last Resort: The Diaspora Communities of Shanghai</h2><p>This book examines two large and generally overlooked diaspora communities, one Jewish and the other Slavic, which found refuge in Shanghai during the period 1900-1950. Victims of discrimination and persecution in their own lands&#x2015;Central and Eastern Europe, Russia, and Ukraine&#x2015;they chose Shanghai as their destination because no documentation was required to enter the city and settle there. In their struggle to survive and build a life in this Chinese open port, they encountered severe political, social, economic, and cultural challenges. The Jewish diaspora community began forming in the early 1900s and increased to more than 18,000 after the initial triumphs of Nazism. The Slavic community eventually numbered about 30,000 people, escaping revolution and persecution from Bolshevik and fascist forces at home and in north China. This book focuses on how these diverse groups, adhering to various religious and cultural traditions, formed communities, preserved their national and cultural identities, chose their leaders, found gainful employment, coped with the alien Chinese culture, educated and raised their children, and established a considerable presence in this large, cosmopolitan city. The author examines at length the different experiences and responses of the two diaspora groups during World War II under the Japanese occupation of Shanghai. With the Chinese Communist takeover of the city in 1949, both groups found themselves in a renewed struggle to find a home, adding still another chapter to the saga of their diaspora experiences. The book concludes with an account of how the two groups handled this new challenge and where they finally found refuge. Apart from the particulars of the Shanghai experience, the story of the two communities clearly resonates with today&#x2019;s accounts of societies in conflict, dislocated populations, and varied struggles to survive and sustain life under trying conditions.</p><p>&#x201c;For her meticulous and fascinating study of the Slavs&#x2014;Russians, Ukrainians, Poles&#x2014;and Jews, who lived in Shanghai from the early 1920s until well after the Communist victory in 1949, Marcia Ristaino has made use of Chinese, Japanese, German, Russian, and English sources to describe the survival of a refugee community that at one time numbered over 50,000 people. . . . Ms. Ristaino has written a remarkable book. She describes well the lives of heroes, villains, spies, collaborators, prostitutes, and many other people simply doing their best to survive.&#x201d;&#x2014;The New York Review of Books<br>&#x201c;This is an academic book and possesses scholarly strengths . . . a thoroughly researched, impressive and sometimes fascinating piece of work, interwoven with themes that resonate to this day.&#x201d;&#x2014;TIME Magazine, AsiaMarcia Reynders Ristaino is Senior Chinese Acquisitions Specialist at the Library of Congress.

Brown</b><i>, President, FIRE School of Ministry</i><br>"This book is a landmark contribution on the nature and significance of Messianic Judaism. It shows clearly that Messianic Judaism is not an ephemeral epiphenomenon that can any longer be ignored or marginalized; on the contrary, it poses an acute set of theological and ecclesiological questions that will take years to resolve. Written with pleasing economy and depth, this volume is indispensable reading for anyone who has forgotten the Jewish origins of Christianity or who has become complacent about the contested nature of their current ecclesial identity. I recommend it with enthusiasm."<b>- William J.

Vaillant, MD, Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School&nbsp;"At last, we have the definitive book on psychodynamic therapy. The authors weave together traditional psychodynamic strategies and techniques with up-to-date developments in the field. The chapters are extremely well written, containing clinical examples that illustrate the strategies and techniques. The volume integrates psychotherapy with couple and family therapy, positive psychology, and combined psychotherapy and psychopharmacology. I highly recommend this book to clinicians and students who want the latest on psychodynamic therapy."--Aaron T. Beck, MD, University Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania&nbsp;"This important work combines the wisdom of experienced therapists with current empirical research. The book includes thoughtful discussions of alliance, transference, and interpretation, along with newer understandings of narrative and trauma.

The result is a scholarly, nuanced, and innovative work that will be highly useful for beginning clinicians, supervisors, and even experienced clinicians across all major theoretical orientations. Summers and Barber debunk outdated and stereotyped ideas about dynamic psychotherapy by describing in a clear, pragmatic manner the core principles and the unique aspects of a dynamic approach. The clinical examples are vivid and resonant, illustrating the added value of dynamic principles for understanding and intervening with patients. A 'must read'!"--Kenneth N. Levy, PhD, Department of Psychology, Pennsylvania State University<p>"This timely, up-to-date, and remarkably useful book will be accessible to readers from a broad range of professional backgrounds. It will be of particular interest to therapists-in-training who are relatively unfamiliar with psychoanalytic theory and seek a hands-on guide that incorporates the latest developments in clinical thinking and research. At a time when many psychiatry residencies and clinical psychology graduate programs neglect to provide adequate training in this pivotal approach, the book provides a much-needed corrective. Summers and Barber convey the wisdom, clinical sophistication, and vitality of psychodynamic therapy in a way that speaks to the sensibilities and needs of a new generation of therapists.

(<i>Journal of Clinical Psychiatry</i> 2012-11-07)<br><br>"The authors' combined wealth of practical experience with clients, students, and research has led to the development of a useful model for practitioners, trainers, and students....The concepts and techniques of 'pragmatic psychodynamic psychotherapy' (PPP) are introduced by means of a case study. PPP involves clear diagnosis and case formulation, which is shared with the client and used to agree a focus for the work. Rather than the traditional 'black screen,' an active, warm, and engaged way of working is advocated....A very useful book for practitioners, students, and trainers alike." (<i>Therapy Today</i> 2012-11-07)<br><br>"The book's value lies in its ability to function as a tool for engendering the growth and development of psychodynamic therapeutic competency....This book has enormous value to both students and advanced practitioners.

This allows them to debunk prevalent myths about psychodynamic theory and practice....The authors organize the presentation of PPP to reflect the three phases of psychotherapy, opening, middle, and ending. They use jargon-free language and they weave clinical vignettes into the chapters in a way that makes difficult concepts readily accessible to learners. One reviewer, a psychiatry resident, found this work to be a very useful synthesis of disparate sources of information regarding psychodynamic theory and practice. The very concrete examples in the clinical vignettes and the tables of key principles made it effortless to assimilate the concepts outlined in the text. Reading this work helped him shape his practice and encouraged him to use psychodynamic psychotherapy with a variety of patients....It is a guide to a mysterious and sometimes difficult area of mental health care.

This book's value lies in its ability to function as a tool for engendering the growth and development of psychodynamic therapeutic competency....This book has enormous value to both students and advanced practitioners.

Davis Bunn</b> was recognized internationally as a consultant, lecturer, and speaker in the area of international finance and received invitations to address symposiums, conferences, and management meetings. His professional interests took a decided turn nearly eighteen years ago. Although he continued his career in international finance, he became a "closet" novelist. For nine years, he wrote with discipline and drive, never to have anything published. When one of his novels came to the attention of Bethany House Publishers, his status as an unpublished novelist changed. His first book, <i>The Presence, </i>was published in 1990 and quickly became a bestseller.<p></p> <p>A prolific writer, he now has over twenty books in publication, including three with Janette Oke, a wonderful children's picture book called <i>Princess Bella and the Red Velvet Hat</i>, the heartwarming gift book <i>The Quilt,</i> and his latest, <i>The Dream Voyagers,</i> originally published under the pen name Thomas Locke.</p> <p>"The novels I've had published by Bethany House are the direction I hope my future writing will take--captivating stories of intrigue, drama and faith, with compelling characters in an enjoyable contemporary fictional setting," says Bunn. "The emotional bonding that occurs with the reader in good fiction often gives the Christian message more direct meaning in the reader's life."</p> <p>Prior to his work in international finance, Davis completed studies in psychology and economics at Wake Forest University. Fluent in three languages, he has traveled extensively in more than forty countries in Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. Davis has also avocationally become a serious student of comparative religion, learning from Jewish rabbis, Buddhist monks, Muslim imams, Catholic priests, and Baptist ministers.

At that time, we were the smallest commercial brewery in the country. We wanted to make beers that weren&#x2019;t referencing commercially dominant styles and beers that incorporate exotic ingredients from around the globe. Or as we call it: Off-centered ales for off-centered people. <br><br> <b>What effect has being the host of <i>Brew Masters</i> on Discovery Channel had on the brewery and/or the Dogfish Head brand? </b><br> We&#x2019;ve been very fortunate that demand for our off-centered ales has been beyond our ability to make them for the last eight years. So the show hasn&#x2019;t helped us sell more beer but it has helped spread the word about Dogfish and about the craft brewing renaissance happening around the globe right now. We&#x2019;ve had a blast doing the <i>Brew Masters</i> show, and I am most proud of the moments in it that celebrate how talented and passionate all of my co-workers are as they do their jobs. Also, the show does a great job of demystifying the brewing process and makes it approachable for people just getting into all of the amazing and diverse beers that are being made by small indie breweries now. <br><br> <b>What can readers expect to get out of this new updated and revised edition of <i>Brewing Up a Business</i>? </b><br> There&#x2019;s still great stuff on what we learned at Dogfish as we started our business, but there is now more content devoted to ideas we&#x2019;ve incorporated to grow our business. With chapters on utilizing social media (my wife Mariah is the queen of this at Dogfish) and differentiating your product or service in a crowded marketplace. <br><br> <b>What&#x2019;s in store for the future of Dogfish Head? </b><br> Lots of new and exotic beers, for sure. There will also be a <i>Brew Masters</i> episode centered around a brewpub we are working on that will be on a rooftop in New York City called Eataly. The restaurant will be run by Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich and Dogfish. Birra Del Borgo (Rome) and La Baladin (Turin) are the contributing breweries to the project. We&#x2019;ve expanded our brewery and our website. We plan to build a bigger distillery and open another pub in 2012. Mostly, we just want to keep putting the where in Delaware and the mental in experimental. <br></p><p><i>Brewing Up a Business</i> reveals how Sam Calagione built Dogfish Head Craft Brewery from a tiny operation to one of the fastest growing breweries in America by dreaming big, working hard, and thinking differently. Packed with real-world lessons every businessperson can learn from, this revised edition includes new chapters on Sam's most innovative and unconventional marketing techniques, including how Dogfish uses social media to level the playing field against bigger competitors&#x2014;and how you can too. <p>"Rarely is a book as good as a beer, but this one is.

Scott Fitzgerald)</h2><p>Cecilia Brady, the daughter of a great motion-picture producer, reminisces about events that began five years earlier when she was an undergraduate at Bennington College, starting with a flight home to Hollywood on a plane whose other passengers included Wylie White, a script writer down on his luck, Manny Schwartz, once an influential producer, and Monroe Stahr, another producer and partner of Cecilia&#39;s father, Pat Brady. Cecilia is attracted to Stahr, and he turns to her at the very time that he has a falling out with her father. Each of the partners conceives the idea of murdering the other. On the way to New York to establish an alibi, Stahr repents and decides to revoke his orders that will result in Brady&#39;s death, but his plane crashes before he can carry out his new plan and Cecilia loses both her father and the man she loves. Even in its incomplete form, The Love of The Last Tycoon: A Western has achieved a reputation as the best Hollywood novel. When F. Scott Fitzgerald died in 1940 he had written seventeen of thirty projected episodes. In 1941 the &#34;unfinished novel&#34; was published in a text for general readers by Edmund Wilson under the title The Last Tycoon. For more than fifty years this edition has been the only one available. This critical edition of The Love of the Last Tycoon utilizes Fitzgerald&#39;s manuscript drafts, revised typescripts, and working notes to establish the first authoritative text of the work. This volume includes a detailed history of the gestation, composition, and publication of the novel; full textual apparatus with editorial notes; facsimiles of the drafts; and explanatory notes on topical allusions and historical references for contemporary readers. The reconstruction of Fitzgerald&#39;s plan for the thirteen unwritten episodes is particularly useful. F.

His inland forays are unique in the literature of circumnavigators as he finds danger, humor, friendship and romance in places most sailors will never visit. James' story unfolds in his earnest exploration of distant lands and seas, his meditations on the people whose lives he touched, and his greater voyage to explore his own private ocean of solitude.<br><br>His adventure is not merely an attempt to seek thrills, nor even to tempt death, but rather a voyage of discovery as he set out in the direction of his youthful dreams to meet the life he imagined.<br><br>"Go seek what you will, where you will,<br>but be a seeker all of your life."<br>-James Baldwin</p><p>"Baldwin's crisp, clear writing carries the reader forward...the book has a&nbsp;reflective tone as Baldwin examines his own growth during the journey and the many lessons he learned that only the sea can teach." -Practical Sailor Magazine, July 2012<br><br>"His tales of the hikes and the people are as fascinating as the stories of his voyages and times at sea.

Understanding these patterns of reasoning helps students to better analyze, evaluate, and construct arguments and to more easily comprehend the full range of everyday arguments found in ordinary journalism. <em>Critical Thinking</em> distinguishes itself from other texts in the field by emphasizing analytical reading as an essential skill. It also provides detailed coverage of argument analysis, diagnostic arguments, diagnostic patterns, and fallacies. <br> Opening with two chapters on analytical reading that help students recognize what makes reasoning explicitly different from other expository activities, the text then presents an interrogative model of argument to guide them in the analysis and evaluation of reasoning. This model allows a detailed articulation of "inference to the best explanation" and gives students a view of the pervasiveness of this form of reasoning. The author demonstrates how many common argument types--from correlations to sampling--can be analyzed using this articulated form. He then extends the model to deal with several predictive and normative arguments and to display the value of the fallacy vocabulary. Designed for introductory courses in critical thinking, critical reasoning, informal logic, and inductive reasoning, <em>Critical Thinking</em> features hundreds of exercises throughout and includes worked-out solutions and additional exercises (without solutions) at the end of each chapter. An Instructor's Manual, including solutions to the text's unanswered exercises and featuring other pedagogical aids, is available.</p><p>Larry Wright is at University of California, Riverdale.</p><h2>Greek Astronomy (Dover Books on Astronomy)</h2><p><p>Astronomy as a science began with the Ionian philosophers, with whom Greek philosophy and mathematics also began. While the Egyptians and Babylonians had accomplished much of astronomical worth, it remained for the unrivalled speculative genius of the Greeks, in particular, their mathematical genius, to lay the foundations of the true science of astronomy. In this classic study, a noted scholar discusses in lucid detail the specific advances made by the Greeks, many of whose ideas anticipated the discoveries of modern astronomy.<br>Pythagoras, born at Samos about 572 B.C., was probably the first to hold that the earth is spherical in shape, while his later followers anticipated Copernicus with the then-startling hypothesis that the earth was not the center of the universe but a planet like the others. Heraclides of Pontus (c. 388&#x2013;315 B.C.), a pupil of Plato, declared that the apparent daily rotation of the heavenly bodies is due, not to a rotation of the heavenly sphere about an axis through the center of the earth, but to the rotation of the earth itself around its own axis. Secondly, Heraclides discovered that Venus and Mercury revolve around the sun like satellites. Perhaps the greatest astronomer of antiquity was Hipparchus, who flourished between 161 and 126 B.C. He compiled a catalog of fixed stars to the number 850 or more, made great improvements in the instruments used for astronomical observations, and discovered the precession of the equinoxes, among other accomplishments. The astronomy of Hipparchus takes its definitive form in the <i>Syntaxis</i> (commonly called the <i>Almagest</i>) of Ptolemy, written about A.D. 150, which held the field until the time of Copernicus.<br>The extraordinary achievements of these and many more Greek theorists are given full coverage in this erudite account, which blends exceptional clarity with a readable style to produce a work that is not only indispensable for astronomers and historians of science but easily accessible to science-minded lay readers.</p><p></p></p><p><p><b>Thomas Little Heath: Bringing the Past to Life <br></b>Thomas Little Heath (1861&#x2013;1940) was unusual for an authority on many esoteric, and many less esoteric, subjects in the history of mathematics in that he was never a university professor. The son of an English farmer from Lincolnshire, Heath demonstrated his academic gifts at a young age; studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, from 1879 to 1882; came away with numerous awards; and obtained the top grade in the 1884 English Civil Service examination. From that foundation, he went to work in the English Treasury, rose through the ranks, and by 1913, was permanent secretary to the Treasury, effectively the head of its operations. He left that post in 1919 at the end of the first World War, worked several years at the National Debt office, and retired in 1926. </p><p>During all of that time, however, he became independently one of the world's leading authorities on the history of mathematics, especially on the history of ancient Greek mathematics. Heath's three-volume edition of <i>Euclid</i> is still the standard, it is generally accepted that it is primarily through Heath's great work on Archimedes that the accomplishments of Archimedes are known as well as they are. </p><p> </p><p>Dover has reprinted these and other books by Heath, preserving over several decades a unique legacy in the history of mathematical scholarship. </p><p><b> </b></p><p><b>In the Author's Own Words:<br></b>"The works of Archimedes are without exception, monuments of mathematical exposition; the gradual revelation of the plan of attack, the masterly ordering of the propositions, the stern elimination of everything not immediately relevant to the purpose, the finish of the whole, are so impressive in their perfection as to create a feeling akin to awe in the mind of the reader." &#x2014; Thomas L.

His father is gravely ill. His elitist boss is just now coming out of rehab. The brilliant lawyer he'd hoped to start a relationship with has gone back to her husband in Chicago. And first young soldier from Black River Falls returns home from a strange place called Viet Nam. In a coffin.<br><br> Against this background McCain tries to enjoy himself during the long Labor Day weekend party the town sponsors every year, reuniting with several old friends who appeared throughout the first six novels. Now that they're all in their late twenties some of the old grudges and rivalries seem silly&#x2015;until two of them are murdered for what seems to be a motive buried in the past.<br><br> With the Beatles, Rolling Stones, and Bob Dylan irritating those over thirty&#x2015;and the boys in long hair and girls wearing blouses without bras irritating people even more&#x2015;Sam McCain is forced to realize that his old world, along with the entire country's, is about to end forever.</p><p>Ed Gorman has received the Shamus Award, the Spur Award, and the International Fiction Writers Award. Ed lives in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.In the eighth entry in the Sam McCain series, set in 1965 and following Fools Rush In (2007), the small-town Iowa lawyer becomes a lightning rod for animosity when he helps to organize an antiwar rally. Retired army colonel Lee Bennett is outraged at what he perceives to be the demonstrators&#x2019; disrespect for the many young dead soldiers, among them his own son. When Bennett turns up murdered, suspicion falls on the rally&#x2019;s leader, Doran. Although McCain regards Doran as a poseur, he agrees to represent him because he knows none of the town&#x2019;s other lawyers will step up. When Bennett&#x2019;s business partner is also murdered, McCain realizes there&#x2019;s a lot more to the case than politics. Gorman casts a sardonic eye on characters from both sides of the political aisle even as he astutely captures the fractious era&#x2019;s divisiveness. Meanwhile, McCain is unafraid to go toe to toe with the town&#x2019;s leading citizens, many of whom he grew up with, as he digs for information. An absorbing mystery that offers an insightful portrait of small-town dynamics and plenty of deadpan humor. --Joanne Wilkinson</p><h2>The Color of Smoke: A Novel</h2><p><p>The first major novel about Eastern Europe's Roma, or Travelers (Gypsies), by a Romani author, The Color of Smoke is both a work of passion chronicling one young man's rise to manhood and an epic work that conjures up a dark era of world history. It is an undiscovered classic that has been published in several languages since its 1975 appearance in Hungary--but never before in English.</p><p>Inspired by the author's own boyhood in World War II-era Hungary, it is a beautifully written coming-of-age story of a Romani boy torn between the community of his birth and the mainstream society that both entices him and rejects him.</p></p><p><p>&#x201c;After appearing in various European languages, The Color of Smoke has at last been made available in English. Based loosely on Lakatos Menyh�rt&#x2019;s own life, it skillfully and imaginatively portrays the challenges facing the journey from boyhood to manhood of its central figure. As a Romani (Gypsy) adolescent he has to deal with the cultural barriers that separate his own world from the non-Gypsy world as all Roma must do--but he does so surrounded by the terrors of the Second World War, when the Romani people in Hungary were being herded into labor camps, some destined for Auschwitz. Written by an insider, this long-overdue and realistically harsh book opens a window into Romani life at that time and adds to our growing awareness of the Romani experience in Nazi-occupied Europe.&#x201d;<br>&#x23af;Ian Hancock, Director of the Romani Archives and Documentation Center, University of Texas, and author of We Are the Romani People &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Hailed as the crowning achievement of the late Menyh�rt Lakatos, Hungary&#x2019;s foremost Romani (Gypsy) author of the twentieth century, The Color of Smoke has finally appeared in an English translation. Its vivid characters and background illustrate the pathos and resilience of the Roma in Hungary during World War II, when that country was first an ally and then a victim of Nazi Germany. The author has drawn upon his boyhood experiences in this bildungsroman to show how his people, the Roma, denied their basic human rights and forced to scrounge an existence on the margins of society, were part of this society, but never fully accepted by the greater majority nor given equality of status. Finally they became the innocent victims of hatred and genocide along with the Jews when they were engulfed by the Nazi Holocaust.&#x201d; &#x23af;Ronald Lee, LLD, Romani Canadian writer, linguist, and activist &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>ABOUT THE AUTHOR<br>Menyh�rt Lakatos (1926&#x2013;2007) was the prizewinning author of many books.

Organized by theory, this popular text discusses major theorists who represent psychoanalytic, neopsychoanalytic, life-span, trait, humanistic, cognitive, behavioral, and social-learning approaches, while demonstrating the influence of events in theorists&#39; personal and professional lives on the development of these theories. The book also explores the ways in which race, gender, and cultural issues play a part in the study of personality and in personality assessment, and includes numerous examples, tables, and figures that further enhance students&#39; understanding of the content.

The style of writing is almost 'orally' communicated, as if the authors are setting down in a classroom designed for conversational discussion of the topic of Personality development."<br><br>"I've never seen a personality text as good (as Schultz/Schultz), and the students love it. The fact that students actually read the book and report favorably on it is the number one reason I'd be reluctant to change even if I discovered a book I liked more, which hasn't happened yet."</p><h2>Mathematical Methods in Physics and Engineering (Dover Books on Physics)</h2><p>Intended for college-level physics, engineering, or mathematics students, this volume offers an algebraically based approach to various topics in applied math. It is accessible to undergraduates with a good course in calculus which includes infinite series and uniform convergence. Exercises follow each chapter to test the student's grasp of the material; however, the author has also included exercises that extend the results to new situations and lay the groundwork for new concepts to be introduced later. A list of references for further reading will be found at the end of each chapter. <br>For this second revised edition, Professor Dettman included a new section on generalized functions to help explain the use of the Dirac delta function in connection with Green's functions. In addition, a new approach to series solutions of ordinary differential equations has made the treatment independent of complex variable theory. This means that the first six chapters can be grasped without prior knowledge of complex variables. However, since Chapter 8 depends heavily on analytic functions of a complex variable, a new Chapter 7 on analytic function theory has been written.</p><p></p><h2>Birds of India: Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives - Second Edition (Princeton Field Guides, 81)</h2><p><p>The best field guide to the birds of the Indian subcontinent is now even better.

Containing music and text of 201 carols, many in more than one setting, the book is organized in two sections: composed carols, ranging from medieval Gregorian chants to modern compositions, and folk carols, including not only traditional Anglo-American songs but Irish, Welsh, German, Czech, Polish, French, Basque, Catalan, Sicilian, and West Indian songs as well. Each carol is set in four-part harmony, with lyrics in both the original language and English. Accompanying each song are detailed scholarly notes on the history of the carol and on performance of the setting presented. The introduction to the volume offers a general history of carols and caroling, and appendices provide scholarly essays on such topics as fifteenth-century pronunciation, English country and United States primitive traditions, and the revival of the English folk carol. <em>The Oxford Book of Carols</em>, published in 1928, is still one of Oxford's best-loved books among scholars, church choristers, and the vast number of people who enjoy singing carols. This volume is not intended to replace this classic but to supplement it. Reflecting significant developments in musicology over the past sixty years, it embodies a radical reappraisal of the repertory and a fresh approach to it. The wealth of information it contains will make it essential for musicologists and other scholars, while the beauty of the carols themselves will enchant general readers and amateur songsters alike.</p><p>Andrew Parrott is at the Taverner Choir, Consort, and Players.'It is hardly an exaggeration to say that the publication in 1992 of The New Oxford Book of Carols caused a sensation.

Because no one expected her to grow into an important scientist, the records of her early life are sketchy. After all, it was assumed that she would grow up to be a wife and mother. Instead, she was a genius who chose a distinctive path. The author has woven this charming story of Emmy Noether&#x2019;s life around the events that appear in the oral and written records, fleshing out the story with details about life in Germany at the time and what we know about how bright children explore mathematics.</p><p>Tent grew up in western Massachusetts and graduated from Amherst Regional High School and Mt.

She is the author of The Prince of Mathematics: Carl Friedrich Gauss.<p>book paints a picture of one of the most fascinating figures of 20th century mathematics, Emmy Noether.

She makes clear in an immensely civilised (and almost understated) style how her severe disabilities &#x2013; being a woman in a chauvinistic men&#x2019;s world, being of Jewish family in an antisemitic world &#x2013; were, for her, of no real consequence. . . . The story-telling is sympathetic, graphic and convincing. The book is written by an enthusiastic mathematics teacher with, it seems, her Alabama high-school pupils in mind . . . but it will be read with pleasure and profit by anyone, of any age, who loves mathematics, and it should be given by those who do to those who don&#x2019;t.

Yet McLuhan's ideas anticipated a world of media in motion, and its impact on our lives on the dawn of the new millennium.<br>Paul Levinson examines why McLuhan's theories about media are more important to us today than when they were first written, and why the <em>Wired</em> generation is now turning to McLuhan's work to understand the global village in the digital age.</p><p>Paul Levinson is President of Connected Education, offering undergraduate and graduate courses on the Internet since 1985, and Visiting Professor of Communications at Fordham University. He is author of several nonfiction books including the internationally acclaimed <i>The Soft Edge</i> (Routledge 1997) and <i>Learning Cyberspace</i> (1995). His science fiction work has been nominated for the Hugo, Nebula and Sturgeon awards; he is the winner of the HOMer Award for best science fiction novelette of 1996.Levinson continues the illuminating investigation into the evolution of information technologies and their effects on society that he began in <i>The Soft Edge</i> (1997) by offering a clarifying interpretation of the works of the guru of media studies, Marshall McLuhan. Many of McLuhan's intriguing concepts were difficult to grasp due, in part, to his tangled prose style, but primarily because they were far ahead of their time. Now, nearly 20 years after his death, his ideas have come to vivid life in relationship to the computer revolution. Levinson neatly explicates and makes productive use of McLuhan's theories. He shows how McLuhan's concept of the global village is fully manifest in the Internet, as is his concept of the "discarnate man," the beautiful vision of "light-through" --the hypnotic effect of light passing through glass, whether in stained glass windows, television, or computer screens--and his prediction of an inclusive super media. Always lucid and provocative, Levinson explores the psychological impact of digital technologies as well as their profound effects on work and play. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>A History of the Ninth Regiment: Illinois Volunteer Infantry, with the Regimental Roster (Shawnee Classics)</h2><p><p>When the Civil War erupted in April 1861, many German immigrants in Illinois rushed to enlist in the Union Army.

Volunteers from Illinois towns in St. Clair County - Belleville, Millstadt, Mascoutah, Lebanon, and others - marched to Springfield under the command of August Mersy, a veteran of the failed 1848 revolt in Baden, Germany. When these German immigrants reached Springfield, however, Mersy was rejected as commander because of his limited facility with English. Replaced by Colonel Eleazer A. Paine, an Ohioan and West Point graduate, Lieutenant Colonel Mersy fell to second in command of the Ninth Illinois Infantry Volunteers. As the two officers led the Ninth off to war, Mersy condemned Paine as a martinet and a politician. Within a few months, however, Paine received a promotion to general that left Mersy in charge of the Ninth. Once Grant began his Tennessee River campaign, the Ninth found itself in the thick of battle, bearing the brunt at Fort Donelson of the Confederate attempt to break Grant&#39;s siege lines. Less than two months later, the Ninth shored up sagging Union lines after the surprise Confederate attack at Shiloh Church, retreating only when their ammunition was gone. Depleted in numbers, the Ninth received 103 men from the 128th Illinois from Williamson County and 105 imprisoned deserters, who, under the influence of the veterans of the Ninth, became acceptable soldiers. After eighteen months of heavy fighting, the Ninth guarded supply lines. When the original three-year enlistment expired, only forty veterans from the original regiment reenlisted.<p><b>Marion Morrison</b> was the chaplain of the Ninth Regiment Illinois Volunteer Infantry.</p></p><h2>2019 ASHRAE Handbook -- HVAC Applications (I-P) (ASHRAE Applications Handbook Inch/Pound)</h2><p>The 2019 ASHRAE Handbook HVAC Applications, extensively updated and expanded for this year, comprises more than 65 chapters covering a broad range of facilities and topics, written to help engineers design and use equipment and systems described in other Handbook volumes.

No artist of the twentieth century has aroused more passion and controversy, nor exerted a greater influence on art--the very essence of which Duchamp challenged and redefined as concept rather than product by questioning its traditionally privileged optical nature. At the same time, he never ceased to be engaged, openly or secretly, in provocative and enigmatic activities and works that transformed traditional art-making procedures. This definitive monograph, written with the enthusiastic support of Duchamp&#39;s widow, challenges received ideas, misunderstandings, and misinformation</p><p>One of the most controversial and influential artists of the 20th century, Marcel Duchamp, a.k.a. Rrose S�lavy and R. Mutt, was born in 1887 in Blainville, France. The brother of artists Raymond Duchamp-Villon and Jacques Villon, Duchamp himself began to paint in 1908. After producing several canvases in the current mode of Fauvism, he turned toward experimentation and the avant garde, producing one of his most famous works, the cubist &#34;Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2&#34; (1912), which caused a furor in New York at the 1913 Armory Show. He painted very little after 1915, with the notable exception of his most challenging work, &#34;Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even&#34; (1915-1923). Perhaps his most important legacy was the ready-made, a radical rethinking of the artwork initiated by Duchamp with his &#34;Fountain&#34; (1917), which consisted of a mass-produced ceramic urinal, turned upside down, signed &#34;R. Mutt,&#34; and exhibited in a gallery setting. After his brief creative period, Duchamp virtually retired from the art world and spent the remainder of his life playing chess. He died in Paris in 1968.Text: English, Italian (translation)</p><h2>Mechanical Analysis and Design</h2><p>Rigorous in approach, this book provides the strong theoretical background -- based on the principles of mechanics -- necessary for mechanical component analysis and design.

Less familiar standouts are Margaret Randall, Melanie Hope and Joan Larkin, who recalls her father spanking her as a child: "his hands, his strong/ voice telling me I was loved" ("Beatings"). Less laudable is the editor's contribution. Coss, a psychotherapist, neatly quarters material into sections that follow the letters of the word love (light, order, vexation, and endurance/evolution/ecstasy). Coupled with simplistic introductions to each section, her "arc" resembles a 12-step program in which weaker poems are included because their sentiments fit the pattern.

Her body of work is small: a novel, a play, and six short stories. And now we have her letters - 133 of them - which, like everything she wrote, are exercises in literary precision. As her editor Millicent Dillon writes, "they are exercises in emotional accuracy as well," little essays in which Bowles explained her joys, doubts, and obesssions to herself and to her correspondents, including her husband, Paul Bowles.<br>Includes 14 pages of black-&amp;-white photographs.</p><p>Millicent Dillon is the author of A Little Original Sin: The Life and Work of Jane Bowles.I have long been an admirer of Jane Bowles's work. Now I am struck again by the subtlety, sharpness, and surprise of her observation, the cool economy of her style, in fact by the rare originality and considerable depth of her writing. --Sybille Bedford<br><br>I consider her the most important writer of prose fiction in modern American letters. Her work, her life: deep truth, observed without pretension, with humor and humanity. An artist and person, an angel. --Tennessee Williams</p><h2>Jewish Messianism and the History of Philosophy</h2><p>Martin Kavka challenges the ancient opposition between Athens and Jerusalem by retrieving the concept of meontology (the doctrine of nonbeing) in one strand of the Jewish philosophical and theological tradition.

Jewish Messianism and the History of Philosophy also offers new readings of important figures in contemporary Continental philosophy, critiquing arguments about the role of lived religion in the thought of Jacques Derrida, the role of Greek philosophy in the thought of Emmanuel Levinas, and the ethical import of the thought of Franz Rosenzweig."Exceeding all other work on modern Jewish thought, this book engages the history of philosophy and the history of Jewish philosophy. The question of the me on, the not-being, is a central question for both traditions, leading from pre-Socratics,through Plato and Aristotle, and then obsessing certain thinkers until today...[the author's] relentless philosophical voice allows him to delve into extremely complex and challenging questions with astonishing clarity. Because he is asking for a specific purpose, he can plumb the depths of the relation of being and non-being, without drowning the reader in jargon or metaphysical haze. No reader will fail to learn a great deal from his enquiry and his argument." Robert Gibbs, author of Correlations in Rosenzweig and Levinas and Why Ethics? Signs of Responsibilities<br><br>"In our apocalyptic, ironic age, a book about nothing hardly makes us lugh. But Martin Kavka's prodigious wit lightly carries his dense study of meontology, the logic of nonbeing. Broad enough to encompass Husserl and Maimonides, Plotinus and Hermann Cohen, Jewish Messianism and the History of Philosophy will appeal to diverse audiences with uncommon success; and it will reshape even as it reintroduces Judaism into contemporary philosophy and Christian theology." - Gregory Kaplan, Rice University, Modern Theology<br><br>"Martin Kavka's Jewish Messianism and the History of Philosophy combines an extraordinary breadth and depth of scholarship with a degree of living thinking and ethical passion that is indeed rare and wonderful. It is framed as a love letter, an invitation to conversation, addressed to a friend, a Rabbi, and to us, his readers. It is an invitation that I take personally." --Kenneth Reinhard, Journal of the History of Philosophy</p><h2>Reading Middle English Literature</h2><p>This introduction provides the guidance that modern readers need to come to an informed appreciation of the writings of medieval England.<br> <ul> <li>An introduction to English literature written in the four centuries following the Norman Conquest.<br> </li> <li>Written by the well-known medievalist, Thorlac Turville-Petre.<br> </li> <li>Demonstrates that Middle English literature is more accessible than is often supposed.<br> </li> <li>Provides readers with the guidance they need to come to an informed appreciation of the writings of medieval England.<br> </li> <li>Designed to be used alongside <i>A Book of Middle English,</i> (Third Edition, Blackwell Publishing, 2005).</li> </ul></p><p><i>Reading Middle English Literature</i> is a study of English literature written in the four centuries following the Norman Conquest. Written by the well-known medievalist Thorlac Turville-Petre, it demonstrates that Middle English literature is much more accessible than is often supposed and provides the guidance that modern readers need to come to an informed appreciation of the writings of medieval England. <br> <p>The book focuses on the representative selection of texts in <i>A Book of Middle English</i> (Third Edition, Blackwell, 2005), ensuring that readers have easy access to the primary material under discussion. It offers new and detailed readings of these texts in light of attitudes to the language, the means of book-production, the society for which the texts were written, concepts of history and romance, the religious practices of the age, and ideals of love and marriage.<br> </p><b>Thorlac Turville-Petre</b> is Professor of Medieval English Literature at the University of Nottingham.

Burrow) <i>A Book of Middle English</i> (Third Edition, Blackwell, 2005).</p><h2>Mr. Mike: The Life and Work of Michael O&#39;Donoghue</h2><p>An account of the life and high times of the late satirist, a writer for National Lampoon magazine and &#34;Saturday Night Live,&#34; where he created the infamous &#34;Mr. Bill&#34; series</p><p>"I had a funny thought: What if Ed Sullivan were tortured? And when I say tortured what I mean is, what if steel needles, say six inches long, were plunged into Ed's eyes? I think it would go something like this...[several minutes of horrible screaming and thrashing]."<p> Now that the <i>National Lampoon</i> is virtually defunct, and <i>Saturday Night Live</i> has turned into just another late-night network cash cow, you can be excused for forgetting about Michael O'Donoghue. But back in the glory days of the 1970s, O'Donoghue gave both their distinctive edge of viciousness, death, and celebratory mayhem. Even though O'Donoghue died (prematurely) in 1994, his legacy in American comedy is still strong. Dennis Perrin has done a boon service by bringing this American original out of the shadows.</p><p> For the devoted fan of O'Donoghue--you're likely either one of those, or nothing--<i>Mr. Mike</i> is often more tantalizing than completely fulfilling. Though his life and career are described in welcome detail, the author's attempts at analysis are less sure. For example, Perrin lets O'Donoghue off much too easily when discussing the sinister elements of his work: Was his obsession with Nazis--one of his tried-and-true comic devices--anti-Semitic? What was his fascination with S&amp;M, mutilation, and torture all about, and how much did the readers really connect with it? Was O'Donoghue a self-made artist in the right place at the right time, or did the culture around him create his distinctive double-dark worldview? Since O'Donoghue himself was highly intellectual and analytical regarding his feral art, one expects answers to these questions, but they are not forthcoming.</p><p> Gaps in analysis aside, fans of American humor owe Perrin big-time; for better or worse, O'Donoghue remains as unique and seminal as ever, and <i>Mr. Mike</i> goes an awfully long way towards ensuring that its subject doesn't fade into literary obscurity, at the very same time that the style of humor he created becomes more and more mainstream. <i>--Michael Gerber</i></p>Dennis Perrin has written about pop culture and politics for a variety of publications, including The Chicago Tribune, Spin, and Mother Jones, and has contributed to &#34;Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher.&#34; He has appeared on CNN, C-Span, CNBC, and NPR, and at many leading universities. Mr. Perrin lives in New York City with his wife and two children.</p><h2>Lessons From The Light</h2><p>The near-death experience (NDE) is not only a revelation of the most profound and soul-shattering beauty, but, as research shows, it is something that has the power to drastically transform and improve the lives of those who survive this kind of encounter with death. Lessons from the Light: What We Can Learn from the Near-Death Experience is unlike other books on the NDE in that it is written not so much about these life-changing encounters as such but for persons who have never had an NDE themselves yet wish to learn from those who have. Lessons from the Light recounts not only many inspiring NDEs from persons of all ages (including very young children) and classes, but for the first time also discloses Dr. Ring&#39;s collection of cases where persons journey beyond the Light as well as the NDEs of blind persons. Such remarkable testimony is then used as a basis to provide helpful guidance and practical exercises in order for readers to live a life of greater self-insight, self-compassion, and concern for others, as well as to be better prepared for death, dying, and bereavement.</p><p>Kenneth Ring, Ph.D. is Professor Emeritus of Psychology at the University of Connecticut and Co-Founder and Past President of the International Association for Near-Death Studies. Regarded by many as the &#34;Dean of NDE Researchers,&#34; he is the Founding Editor of the Journal of Near-Death Studies and the author of several books including his best-selling book Life At Death, Heading toward Omega, and The Omega Project. He lives in Kentfield, California.The capstone of Kenneth Ring's career, this book is the distillation of all that death can teach the living. Ring's loving voice turns harrowing and resplendent near-death stories never published before into a practical guide that motivates through its sheer heart-gripping beauty. No reader will ever be able to think of life in the same way again after reading this book. -- Jenny Wade, Ph.D., author of Changes of Mind: A Holononic Theory of the Evolution of Consciousness<br><br>This is unquestionably the most important book on the subject of near-death experience since Moody's Life After Life. -- Ian Wilson, author of The After Death Experience<br><br>Lessons from the Light opens the last door each of us will face in our lifetime. With clarity, wit, and crisp prose, it brings us to the cutting edge of what promises to be the most important discovery ever made in psychobiology-what truly happens after death. -- Fred Alan Wolf, Ph.D., National Book Award-winning author of Taking the Quantum Leap and The Spiritual Universe<br><br>Lessons from the Light is the culmination of Kenneth Ring's rich and extensive career as the foremost researcher of the NDE. One of the very best books on the subject to date, it is a must read for anyone interested in life's possibilities. -- Sukie Miller, Ph.D., author of After Death: Mapping the Journey and director of The Institute for the Study of the Afterdeath<br>A beautiful melding of research and compassionate, intuitive analysis. An inspirational book filled with both spiritual insight and practical information to help us realize our own personal power. -- Caroline Myss, Ph.D. author of Anatomy of the Spirit<br><br>A magnificent achievement! Ring's new book is the best book on NDEs! For while he is indeed one of the leading scholars in the field, he now brings in his heart and shows those of us who haven't had an NDE how to use the inspiration of NDEs to change our lives. -- Charles T. Tart, Ph.D., Professor Emeritus of Psychology, University of California, Davis; author of Altered States of Consciousness and Living the Mindful Life<br><br>A major contribution that offers a wealth of fresh case materials together with balanced and insightful commentary. -- Raymond A. Moody, Ph.D., author of Life After Life and Reunions<br><br>Arguably, the best book yet on the near-death experience. -- Michael Grosso, Ph.D., author of The Millenium Myth and Soulmaking: Uncommon Paths to Self-Understanding<br><br>Lessons from the Light is the best and most complete book on the near-death experience I've ever read, and I believe it will help you overcome your fears of dying. -- Seymour Boorstein, M.D., Associate Clinical Professor of Psychiatry, University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine and author of Clinical Studies in Transpersonal Psychotherapy</p><h2>Death Tourism: Disaster Sites as Recreational Landscape (Enactments)</h2><p>Auschwitz. Hiroshima. Cambodia&#x2019;s killing fields. The World Trade Center. The mass graves of Rwanda. These places of violent death have become part of the recreational landscape of tourism, an industry that is otherwise dedicated to pleasure and escape. In dark places like concentration camps, prisons, battlegrounds, and the sites of natural disasters, how are memory and trauma mediated by <i>thanotourism</i>, or tourism of death?<br>In <i>Death Tourism</i>, Brigitte Sion brings together essays by some of the most trenchant voices in the field to look at the tensions created by the juxtaposition of human remains and food stands, political agendas and educational programs, economic development and architectural ambition. How does a state redefine its national identity after catastrophic trauma? And what is the role of this kind of tourism in defining their new identity? A timely volume on an irresistible subject, this inquiry exposes the intersection of leisure with the inhumane, giving insight into how people respectfully share a public space that is both free and sacred, compelling and tragic.<br></p><p><b>Brigitte Sion</b> is a fellow at the Center for International Research in the humanities and social sciences, a joint initiative of the French National Center for Scientific Research and New York University. She is also author of the forthcoming <i>Absent Bodies, Uncertain Memorials: Performing Memory in Berlin and Buenos Aires</i>.&#x201c;The examination of tourism at the fifteen locations covered in the book frequently makes for uncomfortable reading. But the deeply thoughtful ways some of the most disturbing material is examined confirm Sion&#x2019;s conclusion that &#x2018;These sensitive topics clearly override quick judgement about death tourism, which is often denounced as kitsch, cheap thrills and macabre business&#x2019;: death tourism is both complex and deserving of serious scholarship.&#x201d;<br> (<i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>"This book is a significant contribution to death (and trauma) studies, but it also joins broader<br> work that explores the relationship between human life and place."

Always radical, always extremely Other, Tantra has proven a key factor in the imagining of India. This book offers a critical account of how the phenomenon has come to be. <br><br>Tracing the complex genealogy of Tantra as a category within the history of religions, Hugh B. Urban reveals how it has been formed through the interplay of popular and scholarly imaginations. Tantra emerges as a product of mirroring and misrepresentation at work between East and West--a dialectical category born out of the ongoing play between Western and Indian minds. Combining historical detail, textual analysis, popular cultural phenomena, and critical theory, this book shows Tantra as a shifting amalgam of fantasies, fears, and wish-fulfillment, at once native and Other, that strikes at the very heart of our constructions of the exotic Orient and the contemporary West.</p><p>"A powerful book demonstrating how the Western study of Hinduism, Indian religious texts, and American popular culture have become related to one another in exceptionally intimate and creative ways. Urban refuses to narrate yet another postcolonial narrative about the evil West, producing instead a subtle and much more accurate reading of the cultural encounter that produced, intentionally or not, a new form of erotic mysticism-Western Tantra."&#x2015;Jeffrey J.

Bullough, a Distinguished Professor Emeritus from SUNY, Buffalo, is the author or editor of fifty books, including Sexual Variance in Society and History; Women and Prostitution; A Short History of Homosexuality; Science in the Bedroom and Encyclopedia of Birth Control.The 1969 Stonewall uprising in New York City, which thrust the struggle for civil rights for homosexuals into the consciousness of North Americans, was so seminal an event that it is easy to forget that it did not occur in a vacuum. Editor Bullough (ed., Encyclopedia of Birth Control; coauthor, Sexual Attitudes) redresses this with a collection of 49 short biographies of activists, written by such authors as Felice Picano, James T. Sears, Wayne R. Dines, and Charley Shively. Included are not just gays, lesbians, and transgendered individuals but such figures as Alfred Kinsey, Evelyn Hooker, and Bullough himself, who, although not themselves gay, worked to reduce the stigma attached to homosexuality. Most of the names, with such exceptions as Kinsey, Allen Ginsberg, Christine Jorgensen, and perhaps Franklin Kameny, are undeservedly obscure. A few of the biographies are uneven or awkwardly brief, but overall they admirably convey the passion and commitment of these men and women. This inspiring chronicle of risk takers and trendsetters (the book's original title) merits a place in all history, gay and lesbian studies, and human sexuality collections.<br><i>Richard J.

From 1850 to the present day, the Atlantic has been home to hundreds of ocean liners and cruise ships, each more lavish than the last...all of them symbols of wealth and luxury. Perhaps this is why readers have always been fascinated by the lives of these ships&#x2015;and their deaths. Many of us know the stories of the <em>Titanic</em> and the <em>Lusitania</em>. Both tragedies caused tremendous loss of life, even as they made the ships immortal. But there are many little-known accounts of extraordinary survivals at sea, such as the <em>Inman</em> and International liner <em>City of Chicago</em> that jammed her bow into an Irish peninsula in 1892 but stayed afloat long enough for all to be rescued, or the <em>City of Richmond</em> that survived a dangerous fire in 1891, and a year earlier the <em>City of Paris</em>, whose starboard engine exploded at full speed in the mid-Atlantic and yet miraculously still made port. Often such tales are forgotten even if the ship sank: In 1898 the Holland-America liner <em>Veendam</em> hit a submerged wreck and sank at sea, but all lives were saved&#x2015;so this vessel's dramatic story seemed less important in maritime history than incidents involving human loss. As recently as 2000, the <em>Sea Breeze I</em> sank off the East Coast of the United States while on a positioning voyage, but all her crew members were rescued in a heroic effort by U.S. Coast Guard helicopters. These stories and many others are dramatic, and acclaimed maritime scholar William Flayhart has spent much of the last forty years in search of material from which to create colorful narratives.<br><br> Author of <em>The American Line: 1871&#x2013;1902</em> and coauthor of <em>Majesty at Sea</em> and the first edition of <em>QE2</em>, Flayhart retells classic ocean liner disaster stories while bringing to light never-before-published but compelling episodes in man's ongoing battle with the sea.

And, indeed, maskers of all ranks&#x2015;nobles, clergy, imposters, seducers, con men&#x2015;could be found mixing at every level of Venetian society. Even a pious nun donned a mask and male attire for her liaison with the libertine Casanova. In <i>Venice Incognito</i>, James H. Johnson offers a spirited analysis of masking in this carnival-loving city. He draws on a wealth of material to explore the world view of maskers, both during and outside of carnival, and reconstructs their logic: covering the face in public was a uniquely Venetian response to one of the most rigid class hierarchies in European history. This vivid account goes beyond common views that masking was about forgetting the past and minding the muse of pleasure to offer fresh insight into the historical construction of identity.</p><p>"Fascinating and richly developed.&nbsp;<i>Venice Incognito</i>&nbsp;is a contribution both to urban studies and to the carnivalesque."&#x2014;Natalie Zemon Davis, University of Toronto<br><br> &#x201c;<i>Venice Incognito</i> is a brilliant reassessment of Venetian carnival and the peculiar phenomenon of masking in early modern Venice.

From masking&#x2019;s first recorded appearance in the thirteenth century to its ubiquity in the carnival decline of eighteenth-century Venice, from the dissimulations of Giacomo Casanova to Arlecchino and the commedia dell&#x2019;arte stage, from the social anonymity of the gambling halls to the socially charged debate over Goldoni&#x2019;s radical unmasking of the actor, <i>Venice Incognito</i> traces the shifting functions of the mask and its implications.

During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the anatomy of sensory tissues was described in considerable detail, and important discoveries were made about the proteins and electrical responses of sensory receptors. The most interesting question, however, continued to elude us: how are sights and sounds and smells converted into electrical signals in a form that can be interpreted by the nervous system?<br><br>This process, called <em>sensory transduction</em>, began to be understood only recently, as a result of the development of the techniques of patch-clamp recording and gene cloning. So much progress has now been made that it is possible to say at least in outline (but in most cases in remarkable detail) how transduction occurs for all of the major sense organs of the body. In nearly every case, the external stimulus is caught by a protein embedded in the lipid membrane of the sensory receptor. This protein then changes conformation, either directly producing an electrical signal (as for touch receptors in the skin or for hair cells in the ear and vestibular system) or triggering an enzymatic cascade and a change in the concentration of an intracellular second messenger that generates the electrical response (as in the eye and nose).<br><br>Beginning with fundamental properties of ion channels and G-protein coupled signal cascades, <em>Sensory Transduction</em> provides a comprehensive survey of this new knowledge that, taken as a whole, represents one of the greatest achievements of modern biology and neuroscience: the unraveling of the mechanism of sensation.<br></p><p><br><strong>Gordon L. Fain</strong> is Professor of Physiological Science, Ophthalmology, and Neuroscience at the University of California, Los Angeles. He received a Ph.D. in Biophysics from The Johns Hopkins University in 1973. His research, which has been supported by a Guggenheim Fellowship and a National Institutes of Health MERIT Award, is focused on the mechanism of visual transduction, specifically the role of Ca2+ in modulating the transduction cascade during light and dark adaptation, and the part played by constitutive activation in photoreceptor degeneration. Dr. Fain has been a visiting scholar at St. John's College (University of Cambridge, United Kingdom) and the Rockefeller Foundation Study Center (Bellagio, Italy). In addition to <em>Sensory Transduction</em>, he has authored <em>Molecular and Cellular Physiology of Neurons</em> (1999).<br><br>"<em>Sensory Transduction</em> concentrates firmly on how sensory receptor cells work. Gordon Fain, one of the central players in the unraveling of phototransduction, takes the position that we have now, thanks to some genetics, molecular biology and cell physiology, 'cracked the problem.' His strategy, unashamedly, is to describe cellular mechanisms of transduction, emphasizing a molecular unity and how this links to other branches of neuroscience. The central claim, and it is a remarkable one, is that we know in outline how sensation occurs in all the major senses of the body and that this is one of the great achievements of physiology and neuroscience in the twentieth century.

Capturing the moment of orgasm on camera is usually reserved for the voyeur, the hidden witness. What Rosenberg has done is present herself as the public&#39;s witness via the camera, inviting a number of men into her studio to reenact the ecstasy of release, the moment when potency and vulnerability coexist. The result is a collection of extraordinary photographs that run the gamut of psychosexual expression. Whether her subjects were really giving their best shot or simply indulging in sublime fakery is just one of the very pertinent questions these pictures throw out. In acting out their most abandoned sexual and emotional moment before her lens, Rosenberg&#39;s subjects invite us to step beyond the traditional limits of voyeurism. These beautiful, curious and erotic images reserve the traditional male-on-female gaze and relieve it of some of its associations with misogyny and perversity.

This groundbreaking and powerful theory now forms the basis of computer science. In <i>Turing's Vision</i>, Chris Bernhardt explains the theory, Turing's most important contribution, for the general reader. Bernhardt argues that the strength of Turing's theory is its simplicity, and that, explained in a straightforward manner, it is eminently understandable by the nonspecialist. As Marvin Minsky writes, "The sheer simplicity of the theory's foundation and extraordinary short path from this foundation to its logical and surprising conclusions give the theory a mathematical beauty that alone guarantees it a permanent place in computer theory." Bernhardt begins with the foundation and systematically builds to the surprising conclusions. He also views Turing's theory in the context of mathematical history, other views of computation (including those of Alonzo Church), Turing's later work, and the birth of the modern computer.</p><p>In the paper, "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the <i>Entscheidungsproblem</i>," Turing thinks carefully about how humans perform computation, breaking it down into a sequence of steps, and then constructs theoretical machines capable of performing each step. Turing wanted to show that there were problems that were beyond any computer's ability to solve; in particular, he wanted to find a decision problem that he could prove was undecidable. To explain Turing's ideas, Bernhardt examines three well-known decision problems to explore the concept of undecidability; investigates theoretical computing machines, including Turing machines; explains universal machines; and proves that certain problems are undecidable, including Turing's problem concerning computable numbers.</p></p><p>Chris Bernhardt is Professor of Mathematics at Fairfield University.<p>A fascinating account of Alan Turing's epic research paper, which kicked off the entire computer revolution.

Teaching that the same skills used by &#34;artists&#34; to produce their masterieces can be used to create anything from a computer program to a functional kitchen, he takes the reader through the steps of creating, from conception to action, and how to make the most of each stage as you travel through it. He also covers how to make the right choices to improve your ability to create what you want, and the importance of having a firm grip on current reality and future vision in order to move from where you are to where you want to be. Fritz argues for the power of the individual to choose to become the predominant creative force in his or her life.</p><p>I first became acquainted with this excellent book just about 10 years ago and its fresh approach to catalyzing creativity in step-by-step processes is still helpful and insightful. Fritz's psychological approach to his subject is particularly interesting and helpful in the way he quantifies and makes concrete the different "technologies for creating" he explains. <br>Leslie Meredith <br>Executive Editor &amp; Divisional Vice President <br>Ballantine WellspringA revolutionary program for creating anything, from a functional kitchen to a computer program, to a work of art, Robert Fritz demonstrates that any of us has the innate power to create. Discover the steps of creating; the importance of creating what you truly love, how to focus on the creative process to move from where you are to where you want to be, and much more.</p><h2>Workbook for Elsevier&#39;s Veterinary Assisting Textbook</h2><p><p>Reinforce your understanding of veterinary assisting!

His nautical fiction has been required reading in the Literature of the Sea course at the United States Naval Academy, along with that of Conrad, Melville, and Wouk. He lives on Virginia's Eastern Shore with his wife and daughter, who sometimes sail with him researching his locales aboard his sloop, <i>Frankly Scarlett.</i><p><b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p> The United States Steam Sloop <i>Owanee</i> � Introduced to Lieutenant Ker Claiborne � Within a Damaged Boiler � The Silver-Filmed Eye of Uncle Ahasuerus � Disagreement Relating to the Newly Elected President � Contents of a Carpetbag � Captain Trezevant Boards His Ship </p><p> The black ship's wedge of bow split hammered-iron river from a galvanized sky. Her topmasts tilted above a spiky undergrowth of spars and shears. Smoke streamed from her single funnel off over the gray-green flatness of the East River, merging at last with the sooty pall from the thousands of other ships and homes and factories of Manhattan. </p><p> As Elisha Eaker dropped his boots into trampled mud, the smells of horse dung and coal ashes bloomed in his nostrils. He paid the hack off with a red-dog note, then stood coughing, holding a handkerchief to his lips as its wheels ground away. </p><p> Was it wise, to venture this? Was it really a way out? Or was all pride and folly, the disordered imaginings of a feverish brain? </p><p> Eli was tall and young, with pale, smoothly shaven cheeks. A sword tilted awkwardly at his side. He'd put on the regulation full dress for the first time that morning. Epaulettes from Warnock and lace from Tiffany's; a cocked hat and silk stock and gold-striped pantaloons. </p><p> Marine sentries in pomponed shakos and white gloves snapped to present arms as he reached the gate. He expected them to ask for a password, given the unrest in the city and, indeed, throughout the Republic this apprehensive spring. But they neither questioned nor hindered him, and after a moment he walked on, into the Brooklyn Navy Yard. </p><p> The sloop's masts loomed against the smoldering sky as he headed downhill past foundries and shops echoing with the clang of iron and the shouts of workmen. Her black sides towered from the murky bay. Even immobile, she looked somber and intimidating. </p><p> But did he belong here? Or was he only fooling himself? </p><p> He hesitated again, then pushed doubt away and marched up the gangway. His boot caught, and only the manrope saved him from flinging himself into the dark water that sloshed and bumped a frowsy lumber of dead rats and waterlogged dunnage. At the top he drew in a deep first breath of her, of the curious, deep, peculiar ship-redolence mingled and amalgamated of tar and brass polish, coal dust and slowly mortifying oak, of old food and the damp reek of packed-in men; and beneath it all the sweet, smoky cured-tobacco aroma of the hempen rigging that lifted above him like a frozen whirlwind up into the murky sky. </p><p> A stocky, bullet-headed petty officer aimed him a questioning scowl. Eli saluted him and said, -- Good day. My name is Elisha Eaker, and I am here to join your ship. </p><p><br> Lieutenant Ker Claiborne, U.S. Navy, first lieutenant and acting executive officer of U.S.S. <i>Owanee,</i> had slept for three hours out of the last forty-eight. Two days before, the yard commander had ordered her coaled and provisioned to sail at short order, and her just-dismissed crew remustered from the concert saloons, cider stubes, and panel houses of Five Points and the Bowery. Captain Trezevant had passed the command along with an ironic twist of the lips -- a sardonic humor Ker would have shared, if he had not been so disquieted of late. </p><p> He was in the teak-paneled wardroom, going over a bill of lading by the light of a gimbaled lamp, when one of the ship's boys, looking, as usual, as if he expected to be caned, rapped at the jamb. </p><p> -- What is it, Jerrett? Another of our lads back aboard drunk? </p><p> -- No sir. Gunner Babcock's compliments, and there's a gen'lman on the quarterdeck to see you. </p><p> A caulking hammer tapped somewhere. Ker dipped the pen; held the back of his wrist against his pointed beard, pondering; then etched a line in firm Spencerian. He glanced at the card the boy laid on his desk. -- Tell the gunner I will be up directly. Then carry this to Mr. Glass, if you please. </p><p> The boy vanished, and Claiborne rose, head brushing the varnished beams. He buttoned his coat and took his service cap off a peg. He studied a curved glass tube on the bulkhead. Then turned the lamp down, and went up the companionway. </p><p> The air on deck felt bracing after twenty-four months off West Africa. He'd contracted the fever of the country off the Guinea coast, and it came calling with chills and ague when he drove himself too hard. As he most likely was just now. </p><p> He touched his beard again, looking across the water not at the tropic continent but at his own country; but instead of comfort, memory and apprehension chilled his heart. When Owanee had deployed, two years before, the nation had been quiet. But since she'd returned, it seemed men had gone mad, lost their senses or been mastered by demons. </p><p> Like the Gadarene swine, he thought, we stampede blindly toward an infinite and fatal abyss. </p><p> Forward on the main deck, the gunners were scraping an amber paste of grease and varnish off the Dahlgren, flinging each bladeful into a tin bucket. A few yards aft, the boatswain was supervising a party swaying up the fore-topmast. At a pipe of his silver whistle the hoistlines tautened. The mast stood upright, then lifted its heel just clear of the deck, searching in the wind like an old man's uplifted and uncertain cane. Ker ran a critical eye over the rigging. He'd apprenticed to the art at Annapolis. The old school ship Preble had been just seaworthy enough to jog about the Chesapeake, but her sail plan and fitting out had been classic sailing Navy. Summer cruises to the Caribbean and Mediterranean on the <i>Plymouth</i> added experience of levanters and hurricanes, but it was off the coast of Africa that he'd become a master. Coal was scarce and dear, and <i>Owanee</i> had sailed through most of her service there. </p><p> A curious tableau awaited him on the quarterdeck. A fair-haired young fellow, not badly made, but whose pale face and slack posture gave the impression of a life spent at ease, stood beside the ship's gunner. He was in full dress, but wore no insignia of rank. Ker made him the abbreviated bow one gives a stranger of whose intention one is uncertain. -- Lieutenant Ker Claiborne, at your service. </p><p> -- My name is Elisha Eaker. Late of the firm of Eaker and Callo-well, of Manhattan. </p><p> -- Did you wish to see the purser, sir? If it is a matter of business. </p><p> Eaker hesitated, then drew a document from his sleeve. </p><p> Ker was pondering it when a hoarse snort bellowed from the smokestack. A black cloud shot up, then hovered between mainmast and mizzen like a cloud of summer midges. Greasy flakes fluttered down like black snow. </p><p> -- That turd Hubbard's doing, no doubt, and without the least concern for us topside, said the gunner angrily. </p><p> Eaker glanced around, at the morose-looking seamen, the rows of heavy guns that lined the waist. He flicked a flake of soot from his sleeve. -- Could we perhaps...? </p><p> And Ker said, -- Certainly, sir. If you'll accompany me below? </p><p><br> Eighty feet aft, a scraping clang sounded from within a well of darkness. A moment later a little man in grease-stained denims and a cap with a broken bill emerged headfirst from beneath an iron casting that extended from the shadowy bilges to thick glass skylights thirty feet up. Their pearly glow illuminated a firm chin, determined lips, and deep-set eyes that peered from a face so sooted he resembled a blackface minstrel. </p><p> Theodorus Hubbard, <i>Owanee's</i> engineer, wiped his hands on a twist of cotton and pitched it overhand into a bucket. He braced his diminutive frame against a massive door. It slowly gathered momentum, then slammed shut with an iron boom that traveled the length of the space, dying away along catwalks, pumps, copper-shining piping, gutta-percha hose, glass tube-gauges of foaming water the color of melted opals. He said in a Connecticut twang, -- Pappy, what I want to know is, how you let everything go to hell in just two weeks. </p><p> The burly man above him growled, -- Well, last I heard was they was going to jerk this heap o' junk out of her and install one of them new Isherwoods. Never thought to be takin' her back to sea. </p><p> -- Get them stokers on the rails. Watch the gauge when you cut in the crossover. Let's fire her up, see if she holds. </p><p> MacNail's shout echoed above the inhaling roar of fans and the slap of leather blower belts. Two huge men with Irish faces ran toward them, boots hammering the limber boards laid over bilges black with a slurry of coal dust, ash, and seawater. They seized fascines of kindling, heaved them into the furnace, and tossed bucketfuls of kerosene after. MacNail hastily seated twelve huge iron nuts on the man-cover from which Hubbard had emerged, then began torquing them down with a wrench as the stokers snatched shovels off iron clips and threw coal like men possessed, raising a fine choking dust of black anthracite. </p><p><br> Eli followed Claiborne down a shoulder-wide ladder into a low cabin that smelled of segar smoke, spar varnish, and the rotten-egg stench of sulphur fumigant. The lieutenant pointed to a chair. Eli aligned his cap on his knees and cleared his throat. -- Are you the master of this vessel? </p><p> -- The captain, you mean? No. I am the first lieutenant and executive officer. Just appointed as Captain Trezevant's second in command. </p><p> -- Might I see the captain? </p><p> -- He is not aboard at present. Nor would it be proper for me to intrude your presence upon him without ascertaining your business here, and that in considerable detail. </p><p> The lieutenant looked tired. Eli noticed he wore no sword, and began to doubt whether his own was not out of place. He nudged it around out of sight behind him as Claiborne said, -- Well, sir, let's have another look at those papers. </p><p> As he leafed through them, Eli found his glance arrested by two small gleaming eyes that stared back at him from a fiddle-boarded bookcase. In the dimness he gradually made out that they were set in a tiny wizened face. He stood to examine what he took for a stuffed curio, then put out a hand. And staggered back a moment later, gripping his finger and stifling a scream. </p><p> -- His name's Auguste, said Claiborne as the monkey hopped out, drawing a minuscule paw across its mouth and chattering angrily at the New Yorker. -- Monsieur C. Auguste Dupin, to give him his complete honors. We took him and a few of his compatriots aboard at Porto Praya. As the days passed they gradually grew fewer, but we were hard put to tell where they'd gone. Finally we discovered this fellow here was pitching the smaller ones overboard at night to watch them swim. </p><p> The animal leapt to the floor and scrabbled up the companionway. Claiborne turned the documents over, scanning each with every appearance of interest. Finally he cleared his throat. -- I hope you will not take it amiss if I observe I have never heard of the New York Naval Militia. </p><p> -- Not at all. Eli wrenched his mind away from the ape, how disturbingly its shadowy leer had parodied a human smile. -- It's a volunteer body, recently organized among the better sort of the city. Those who wish to step forward, should the slavocratic conspiracy put our temper to the test. </p><p> -- Should the what? </p><p> -- The renegade Carolinians who feel disposed to insult our flag. </p><p> Claiborne said gravely, -- You must pardon me; I have been absent the country, and am unfamiliar with the political cant of the moment. </p><p> -- You must know that the Deep South states have rejected all compromise, and set up a rump legislature at Montgomery. </p><p> -- I read the journals, sir; and as far as I know, no offer of concession has been tendered them as yet. But let us lay that difficult topic aside. Your purpose in visiting <i>Owanee?</i> </p><p> Eli felt steadily less comfortable. The gravely courteous officer before him was plainly from south of the Mason-Dixon. The fellow's eyes, too, were unsettling, the same pale bleached blue as the noon sky in August. -- I'm here to help in any way you may find convenient. I won't require pay. </p><p> -- No pay, eh? It's true we're shorthanded just now. Claiborne examined the letters again. -- These reflect attendance at Harvard University. What degree did you take? </p><p> -- I was permitted to withdraw after two years, for reasons of health. </p><p> -- You appear robust enough to me. </p><p> Eli said carefully, -- Just now I feel well. </p><p> -- Do you have anything resembling experience at sea? </p><p> -- My family's been in shipping for three generations. I've also spent some considerable time aboard Mr. Cornelius Vanderbilt's private yacht. </p><p> Claiborne's eyebrows rose. -- I see. Aboard his private yacht. You know Mr. Vanderbilt intimately, I take it? </p><p> -- Not intimately, but well enough to speak to. </p><p> The exec mused over this for a moment more, then reached for a bell. -- Ask the bo's'n to step in, he said to Jerrett's apprehensive countenance. -- Your qualifications would not go so far as a mate's ticket, would they, Mr. Eaker? </p><p> -- I'm afraid not. I'm willing to learn, though. And as I said, I will be happy to serve without emolument. </p><p> A tap at the doorjamb, and the exec motioned in a spare, spry old warrant with a furrowed brow, bright black eyes, and a preposterous forked gray-and-tobacco beard that hung below his waist. Claiborne introduced him as Josiah Girnsolver, <i>Owanee's</i> boatswain. He told Girnsolver their visitor had alluded to experience in yachts, and that his qualifications as a sailing officer were under discussion. </p><p> The old man turned his head slowly to the left, then to the right, as if easing a stiff neck. He pulled up a trowser-leg, revealing the top of a prickly-looking red wool sock. Then said in a Down East accent, scratching his ankle thoughtfully, -- Wal, let's say the cap'n tells ya to furl sails. What d'ya say to carry that out, now, sor? </p><p> Eli cleared his throat, calling on Mnemosyne to assist him. -- To furl sails. Well, first I should call away the men. Um, then, command them to go aloft. </p><p> -- "Aloft t'gallant and royal yardmen?" Girnsolver suggested. </p><p> -- Quite so. When they have gained the rigging, get the topmen aloft; then man my clew jiggers -- </p><p> -- Buntlines and clew jiggers? </p><p> -- I was about to say, buntlines as well. When all men are in position, I tell them to furl away. Then when all is complete, to lay down from aloft, I suppose. </p><p> Claiborne prompted, -- And the downbooms? </p><p> -- I should tell them to lay in the downbooms. </p><p> They regarded him noncommittally. The warrant fingered his whistle, which hung from his neck on a lanyard of ornately embroidered marline. He said, -- Say ye're under way by the wind on a starboard tack, under all sail. What d'ya do if the wind hauls aft, as the officer of the deck? </p><p> Eli coughed into his fist, fighting both nervousness and the familiar rising tickle in his throat. -- Maintaining the same course? I should first ease off sheets. Get a pull of the braces. Man the halyards on deck, then haul taut and hoist away. And make sure, ah, make sure the boom, I forget the name of it, but make sure it's ready for coming back in. </p><p> Claiborne asked him, -- How many p...</p></p><h2>Farewell My Lovely</h2><p>A warm day on Central Avenue, and Philip Marlowe&#39;s hunch about the man beside him is as vague as the heat waves that dance above the sidewalk.

The problem of trying to develop a Marxist class analysis on this basis has been made all the more acute by changes in the class structure of advanced capitalism, for these have thrown up a bewildering range of new social strata which seem to be difficult to reconcile with the many traditional understandings of class.<br><br>In <i>Classes</i>, Erik Olin Wright, one of the foremost Marxist sociologists and class theorists, rises to the twofold challenge of both clarifying the abstract, structural account of class implicit in Marx, and of applying and refining the account in the light of contemporary developments in advanced capitalist societies. Recentering the concept of class on the process of exploitation, Wright discusses his famous notion of &#x201c;contradictory class locations&#x201d; in relation to the empirical complexities of the middle class, and he provides an analysis of class structure in &#x201c;post-capitalist&#x201d; societies.

First, it provides a theoretical framework for the study of synchronistic phenomena&#x2015;a framework that enables us to view these phenomena in relation to Jung&#x2019;s model of the psyche and his concept of psychic compensation. Second, this book explores the significant role that these events played in Jung&#x2019;s life and work. And third, by way of a careful examination of the synchronicity theory in relation to the process Jung terms individuation, an examination in which considerable case material is presented, the specific import of this seminal concept for Jung&#x2019;s psychology of religion is disclosed.</p><p><p>Robert Aziz, Ph.D., is a therapist in private practice in London, Ontario.

It resolves two issues which in Jung&#x2019;s own writing and in the secondary sources had remained unclear: the notion of synchronicity and the degree to which individuation involves the external world as well as the inner archetypes. This is a most significant scholarly accomplishment. Throughout, the writing is clear and concise, and the argument is solidly founded on the research sources.&#x201d; &#x2015; Harold Coward, University of Calgary<br><br>&#x201c;In this groundbreaking work, Robert Aziz explores the most pressing issue still confronting Jungian psychology, that issue being our answerability and responsibility to the world. The interaction between the inner and the outer&#x2015;in which for too long the inner has been given almost exclusive priority&#x2015;is rebalanced in this important volume. Synchronicity as interpreted by Aziz avoids priorities and affirms an interaction between equals: nature within and nature without.&#x201d; &#x2015; Marion Woodman, Jungian Analyst, Toronto<br><br>&#x201c;This work is extremely important because it shows through a combination of scholarly research, analysis, and extensive use of examples that Jung&#x2019;s concept of synchronicity is the dynamic essence of his psychology of religion.&#x201d; &#x2015; Marian L.

Yet for all of the gains in our understanding of brain function credited to scientific research, there is a growing body of hype and misinformation about how the brain works.</p> <p><i>Great Myths of the Brain</i> presents a comprehensive examination of myths surrounding the function of the human brain. Cognitive neuroscience expert Christian Jarrett takes on well over&nbsp;50 myths associated with brain function&#x2014;from those based on falsehoods or partial truths to ones cloaked in scientific language. Jarrett first explores general myths, such as the idea that we only use 10 per cent of our brains, or that adults can&#x2019;t grow new brain cells. He then goes on to address a variety of more contemporary issues, including technological myths (can brain scans really read your mind?); structural myths, including the recent hype around mirror neurons; perceptual myths, including the idea that you perceive the world as it really is; and a variety of contemporary myths swirling around brain disorders&#x2014;including epilepsy, autism, and dementia.

Combining traditional learning and contemporary thought, Ouaknin dovetails discussions of spirituality and religious practice with such concepts as deconstruction, intertextuality, undecidability, multiple voicing, and eroticism in the Talmud. On a broader level, he establishes a dialogue between Hebrew tradition and the social sciences, which draws, for example, on the works of L�vinas, Blanchot, and Jab�s as well as Derrida. <i>The Burnt Book</i> represents the innovative thinking that has come to be associated with a school of French Jewish studies, headed by L�vinas and dedicated to new readings of traditional texts, which is fast gaining influence in the United States.</p><br><p> The Talmud, transcribed in 500 C.E., is shown to be a text that refrains from dogma and instead encourages the exploration of its meanings. A vast compilation of Jewish oral law, the Talmud also contains rabbinical commentaries that touch on everything from astronomy to household life. Examining its literary methods and internal logic, Ouaknin explains how this text allows readers to transcend its authority in that it invites them to interpret, discuss, and re-create their religious tradition. An in-depth treatment of selected texts from the oral law and commentary goes on to provide a model for secular study of the Talmud in light of contemporary philosophical issues.</p><br><p> Throughout the author emphasizes the self-effacing quality of a text whose worth can be measured by the insights that live on in the minds of its interpreters long after they have closed the book. He points out that the burning of the Talmud in anti-Judaic campaigns throughout history has, in fact, been an unwitting act of complicity with Talmudic philosophy and the practice of self-effacement. Ouaknin concludes his discussion with the story of the Hasidic master Rabbi Nahman of Bratslav, who himself burned his life achievement--a work known by his students as "the Burnt Book." This story leaves us with the question, should all books be destroyed in order to give birth to thought and renew meaning?</p></p><p><p>"By drawing not only on Derrida, but also on Blanchot, Jab�s, Neher, and Levinas, Marc-Alain Ouaknin has broadened the concepts and themes for viewing the relation of literary theory with Jewish thought. Moreover, his readings of Talmudic texts are rich and exciting, going beyond much of the best work in this field."<b>--Robert Gibbs, Princeton University</b></p><b>Marc-Alain Ouaknin</b>, an Associate Professor in the Department of Comparative Literature at the University of Bar-Ilan in Israel, is a rabbi and has a doctorate in philosophy.

THE LIVES OF MEN, THE CUSTOMS OF PEOPLES, AND THE PAGEANTRY OF NATIONS CHART THE COURSE OF TOMORROW proclaimed a large mural by the front door. The teacher was a tall man, six foot four inches in his socks, with an athletic body (when there were no kids in the building, he sometimes used the many staircases in the school for exercise), short black hair, and a clean-shaven, angular face. He was thirty-eight years old, but could have passed for twenty-eight. Earnest, ardent, industrious, kind, and highly sensitive were traits that came to mind when I thought about the parts of himself this teacher brought into his classroom, week in, week out, all year long. He almost always dressed conservatively, in long-sleeved dress shirts and chinos, and his wardrobe often made me think of leafing through an L.L.Bean catalog, but that day he was wearing a short-sleeved purple South High polo shirt. All the teachers had put on purple shirts, that being the school color, so that the students could easily see whom they should turn to if they had a question about how to find a particular classroom, how to read the confusing schedules they carried, or where they could find the school&#x2019;s elusive cafeteria, way up on the fourth floor. Mr. Williams usually avoided short-sleeved shirts, even in August, because they revealed the dark blue tattoo that circled one of his biceps, and he feared his students might misinterpret the inked designs as macabre, given their backgrounds. He worked diligently to communicate in all sorts of ways that he was a person they could trust.<br> <br>Mr. Williams had inherited his Anglo father&#x2019;s rangy height and propensity to freckle, along with his Latina mother&#x2019;s dark eyes and hair. Fluent in both Spanish and English, he was the sort of teacher who devoted an enormous portion of his warmth, vitality, and intellect to his students. South was a century-old castlelike structure that stood on the edge of a rolling, green, 160-acre park in central Denver, Colorado. The rectangular park boasted meadows, manicured flower gardens, two lakes, a lily pond, meandering carriageways chock-a-block with Lycra-clad joggers, ten much-in-demand public tennis courts, and the busiest recreation center in the city. The grand old homes that ringed the park were selling for upward of $1 million, while modestly sized homes nearby that did not look directly onto the park might sell for half that amount. The neighborhood public high school was a popular choice, even for families who possessed significant wealth. Most of the classrooms were crowded with noisy, chattering teenagers. That morning, however, as he looked around his room, Mr. Williams saw many empty chairs and only seven students. The teenagers assigned to him wore shut-door expressions on their faces. Nobody in the room was talking, not even to one another. The teacher had expected this, for his room always got off to a quiet start.<br> <br>&#x201c;Welcome to newcomer class!&#x201d; he said, in a deliberately warm tone of voice. &#x201c;My name is Mr. Williams. What is your name? Where are you from?&#x201d;<br> <br>The seven teenagers who had reported to Room 142 made no reply. Just the act of showing up by 7:45 in the morning had required enormous fortitude. It was August 24, 2015, and the students had spent on average more than an hour negotiating the local public transit system to get to the school. They lived crammed with other relatives into small houses or one- or two-bedroom apartments located in far-flung neighborhoods nowhere near this upscale zip code, in parts of the city where a dollar could be stretched. Rents had jumped dramatically in central Denver in recent years, and affordable housing could be found only on the city&#x2019;s periphery, if at all. Getting from the patchwork zones of cheap housing located on the farthest edges of the city to South via the public transit system took dogged commitment, but that was a quality that Mr. Williams&#x2019;s students typically possessed in abundance. What they did not possess, for the most part, was the ability to understand what he was saying.<br> <br>&#x201c;Welcome to newcomer class!&#x201d; the teacher repeated, taking care to enunciate each word deliberately. &#x201c;My name is Mr. Williams. What is your name? Where are you from?&#x201d;<br> <br>Mr. Williams often said things twice. It gave his lessons a singsong quality. The students continued to stare back at the teacher without speaking. The technical description for what was happening is &#x201c;preproduction,&#x201d; which in the academic literature about language acquisition is also known as &#x201c;the silent period.&#x201d; The vast majority of second-language learners begin in a quiet receptive phase, able to produce hardly any English themselves, even as their brains furiously absorb everything being said by their teacher.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>That year, about sixteen hundred teenagers attended South High School, and roughly one-third had been born in another country. South served as a regular neighborhood school that drew many English-speaking students as well as one of the designated destinations in the Denver Public Schools system for students who spoke foreign languages other than Spanish and whose education had been interrupted. For many years South had handled the bulk of the city&#x2019;s teenage refugees, for it was primarily children in those families who had significant gaps in their education. War&#x2014;that was what generally caused children to be unable to attend school for long periods of time.<br> <br>About three hundred students at South were presently enrolled in English Language Acquisition classes, and hundreds more had taken those classes in years past. Among them were students who had seen every kind of catastrophe on the planet. The other two-thirds of the student body had always lived in the United States and had been speaking English since birth. Across the United States, students from non-English-speaking backgrounds had become one of the fastest-growing segments of the K&#x2013;12 population. Such students now made up 42 percent of the students served by Denver Public Schools. What was remarkable about South was how well it had been integrating students displaced by extreme forms of upheaval with their American-born peers. The school cultivated a mind-set, widely shared by faculty and students, that everybody under its roof was an asset. Native-born kids helped new arrivals learn English, even as foreign-born students helped their American peers become more global-minded. But first, the newcomers had to adjust. Of all the students jammed into the vast five-story building, the seven souls in Mr. Williams&#x2019;s room had been evaluated as knowing the least English. If any teacher in the building wound up working with a child who had just arrived in the United States as a refugee and did not yet know anything about life on this side of the globe&#x2014;how to ask a bus driver where to get off, what exactly the Broncos were, and whether to eat &#x201c;spicy chicken&#x201d; (the cafeteria served that a lot)&#x2014;it was Mr. Williams.<br> <br>Some people viewed ELA students as occupying a place on the low end of the scale, socially. Eddie Williams disagreed; he saw the chance to work with these teenagers as an extraordinary, life-changing experience, one that lit up his own days with meaning. What took place inside his room always struck him as being as close to a bona-fide miracle as he was likely to experience. If these students showed up every day, he believed, they would evolve and heal and adapt and flourish. Their progress might be achingly slow at first, but after a while they would accumulate small victories with rapidity&#x2014;he had seen it happen before. The closed faces of the students before him would unlock.<br> <br>Not right away. They were still getting acclimated to so many things: the weird sound of American-accented English, the frighteningly large new urban high school, their strange-looking teacher, and the idea of students changing classrooms throughout the day (in many parts of the world, teachers changed rooms). They were still learning the unfamiliar transit routes to and from South and still getting used to homes made of building materials radically different from any structure they had ever lived in before. Even the weather wasn&#x2019;t like the weather they had known previously. But one by one, the students would get over the enormous shock of it all and start speaking back to him, he knew, and ultimately the whole room would be transformed.<br> <br>He also knew that these seven students were only the first to materialize. Over the coming year, the strife-ridden parts of the planet would dispatch many more students to Mr. Williams, he was sure. They turned up that way every year&#x2014;higgledy-piggledy, not when the calendar advised. Some of them would arrive looking alarmingly thin. They could be anywhere from fourteen to nineteen, and a few would not know exactly how old they were. They came from nations convulsed by drought or famine or war, countries that were barely countries anymore. Many came directly from refugee camps. Every so often, he got a student who arrived in the United States alone, having left or lost every other member of his or her family. The students walked into his room dazed at the abruptness of the transition, looking profoundly lost. And then they started over&#x2014;started to figure out where they were, started to wonder who he was, started to ask whether to call this place home.<br> <br>Mr. Williams knew the additional students would come because they always had, and because for several months the front pages of newspapers like the Denver Post, the New York Times, and the Wall Street Journal had been filled with photographs of homeless multitudes. Over the summer, the news cycles had been consumed by reports of Middle Eastern asylum seekers arriving by the boatload in Greece and then walking to Germany. Millions of Syrians had been forced from their homes by the civil war gutting that country; in neighboring Iraq, millions more had been uprooted by a decade of fighting; additional millions had fled escalating violence in Afghanistan. The massive movement of people around the Middle East had thrown the whole region into turmoil. Meanwhile, wars of even longer duration in Asia and Africa had inundated camps in those regions with refugees, too. A total of fifty-nine million people around the world had been displaced from their homes as of that year, according to the United Nations&#x2014;more than at any point since World War II.<br> <br>Because it provided services that drew such families, South High School&#x2019;s population mirrored the state of the world. Twenty years earlier, when the school first put its expanded English Language Acquisition program into place, many of the foreign-born students who walked into the front office had been from Bosnia. Generally, they had been well educated, although perhaps they had missed one or two years of schooling, and they typically lacked English; getting them up to speed had been, in hindsight, relatively straightforward. After the school began its second decade of work with students from other parts of the globe, the front office staff had started greeting an increased number of students from the Middle East, especially Iraq and Afghanistan. Throughout the same period, the school had received large numbers of students from Southeast Asia, primarily Burma, home to the longest-running civil war in the world, a conflict that had raged across its river deltas and its mountain passes for more than sixty years. The school had also welcomed many students from the war-torn parts of Africa&#x2014;at first from Sudan and Somalia, and later from Eritrea, Ethiopia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. South did not yet have a large number of Syrians, but they were coming. If war erupted halfway around the globe, Mr. Williams knew in a few years he would see children from that place.<br> <br>So he did not brood about having too few students; more were on their way. Nor was he anxious when the newcomers did not answer, because when they first arrived, they were almost always speechless. Several years might elapse before certain students would come back to tell him in unbroken sentences who they really were. He was consistently staggered by how much his former students had to tell him, once they got hold of enough English. That was his job, to help them find the words. First he had to get them settled, and that was the biggest challenge. Loss of all kinds had robbed these teenagers of certitude, and his main job at the start of the school year was to show them that they were in a room where they would come to no further harm. It was hard, convincing them it was safe to hope.<br> <br>Mr. Williams taught in a capacious room with a navy blue carpet, white walls, and a high ceiling. A large clock hung directly over the door. The opposite wall featured ten-foot-tall windows with dusty blinds he had closed to keep the room cool, although the sun was peeking through the chinks. Mr. Williams stood with his back to the half-darkened, half-glowing blinds. Because most of the students appeared confused by his greeting, Mr. Williams turned to his aide, Ed DeRose.<br> <br>&#x201c;Welcome to newcomer class!&#x201d; the teacher said again, enunciating each word even more slowly. &#x201c;My name is Mr. Williams. I am from the United States. I speak English. What is your name? Where are you from? What language do you speak?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My name is Mr. DeRose,&#x201d; his aide replied. &#x201c;I am from the United States. I speak English.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nice to meet you,&#x201d; said Mr. Williams.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nice to meet you,&#x201d; responded Mr. DeRose.<br> <br>The two men shook hands and grinned with genuine amusement, as they had worked together for several years. &#x201c;Nice to Meet You&#x201d; happened to be the title of the first chapter in the English Language Acquisition textbook that Mr. Williams employed&#x2014;the book was titled Inside the U.S.A., and the unit began with the most common greetings used by Americans. Mr. Williams walked over to one of his students, extended his hand, smiled warmly, and repeated his questions.<br> <br>&#x201c;What is your name? Where are you from?

I'll give you beauty!"&#x2015;Mary Heilmann</p><p>Mary Heilmann is one of the most important abstract painters of her generation. Her distinctively fluid, humorous, and bright canvases combine the modes of Abstract Expressionism with a vibrant Pop sensibility. Heilmannn's 1979 painting in hot pink and black, evocatively titled <i>Save the Last Dance for Me</i>, marked a shift in the artist's perspective. Heilmann describes it: "Now the work came from a different place. Instead of working out of modernist non-image formalism, I began to see that the choices in the work depended more on content for their meaning." This beautifully illustrated study of <i>Save the Last Dance for Me</i> explores the development of Heilmann's work, and the way it continues to engage us&#x2015;psychologically, sensually, and socially.</p><p>The three bright pink rectangles in Heilmann's painting seem to dance off the edge of the canvas, through a black field that seems dark as a nightclub after midnight&#x2015;or perhaps the three are actually one pink rectangle, seen in a blissfully formal time lapse, moving across the dance floor/canvas. These definitively modernist geometric forms coexist with a sense of movement in real time. For many, abstraction may have been dancing its last dance in 1979, but Heilmann's bright pink rectangles boogie on.</p></p><p>Terry R.

Yu&#x2019;s translation of <i>The Journey to the West</i>,initially published in 1983, introduced English-speaking audiences to the classic Chinese novel in its entirety for the first time. Written in the sixteenth century, <i>The Journey to the West</i> tells the story of the fourteen-year pilgrimage of the monk Xuanzang, one of China&#x2019;s most famous religious heroes, and his three supernatural disciples, in search of Buddhist scriptures. Throughout his journey, Xuanzang fights demons who wish to eat him, communes with spirits, and traverses a land riddled with a multitude of obstacles, both real and fantastical. An adventure rich with danger and excitement, this seminal work of the Chinese literary canonis by turns allegory, satire, and fantasy.<br> <br> With over a hundred chapters written in both prose and poetry, <i>The Journey to the West</i> has always been a complicated and difficult text to render in English while preserving the lyricism of its language and the content of its plot. But Yu has successfully taken on the task, and in this new edition he has made his translations even more accurate and accessible. The explanatory notes are updated and augmented, and Yu has added new material to his introduction, based on his original research as well as on the newest literary criticism and scholarship on Chinese religious traditions. He has also modernized the transliterations included in each volume, using the now-standard Hanyu Pinyin romanization system. Perhaps most important, Yu has made changes to the translation itself in order to make it as precise as possible. <br> <br> One of the great works of Chinese literature, <i>The Journey to the West</i> is not only invaluable to scholars of Eastern religion and literature, but, in Yu&#x2019;s elegant rendering, also a delight for any reader.</p></p><p><p><b>Anthony C.

It covers Irish soldiers, armies and battles in eighteen clearly-organized chronological chapters, ranging from the middle of the first millennium AD to modern times. As a whole it brings a new and exciting dimension to Irish military history, that has concentrated hitherto on battles and tactics. The text is illustrated throughout by over 120 pictures and maps.</p><p>"...[a] valuable first comprehensive "military history" of Ireland....[it] works remarkably well on a number of levels. It is, for example, rich in human-interest detail and anecdotes that will surprise and delight even specialist historians. In a more thematic way, the book succeeds also in being a braod, thousand-year history of the military in Ireland. Thirdly, because so much of Ireland's history has been one of conflict and coercion, the book also can be read profitably as a general history of Ireland. A variety of readers--professor, student, or general public--will find much to enjoy and learn in this very readable volume."

Robert Lynn, Vet Outlook<br><br>"Because the significance of Ireland's military past extends far beyond the country's shores, this study holds importance for military historians working in fields other than Irish history....individually each essay displays a consistently high quality of research and analysis, making important contributions to its given topic.

The bibliography, which contains over 750 items, is the most thorough listing of works on Irish military history available. Not only is this an essential reference for Ireland's military past, it also represents an important contribution to military history in general." Journal of Military History<br><br>"This large, handsomely produced volume ranges from the Middle Ages to the present day, probing the experience of a small country that has witnessed chronic warfare at home and sent its sons in large numbers to wage it elswhere....This is, in short, a comprehensive and engrossing study, of interest not only to students of the history of Britain's former empire, but of military culture in general." Foreign Affairs<br><br>"Not only is this an essential reference for Ireland's military past, it also represents an important contribution to military history in general." Journal of Military History<br><br>"...the Bartlett and Jeffery volume goes far in filling the gaps in Irish historiography....the volume is well integrated....The authors and editors are to be commended for not focusing excessively on episodes of intense military activity....they and the other contributors have produced a work that is likely to stand for many years as the standard general reference on Irish military history." Paul E. Kopperman, AlbionBartlett (Univ. Coll., Dublin) and Jeffery (Univ. of Ulster) have collected 18 essays on the history of the Irish soldier and Irish armies, beginning in pre-1100 and concluding with a review of current military policies and problems in Northern Ireland and the Republic. The essays are written by recognized scholars who are authorities on the times and topics. Several examine the origins of the enviable reputation that medieval Irish soldiers had for stamina and fighting. Others discuss Irish mercenaries and, ironically, the chronically anemic condition of the Republic's military force and how the more robust Irish Republican Army has grown in the north. The current status, policies, and plans of the Republic's army, the paramilitary groups in the north, and their relationships with the U.S. military are objectively explained without lapsing into politics.

With the breakup of his marriage that year, rumors of a scandalous relationship he may have conducted with the young actress Ellen "Nelly" Ternan flourished. For the remaining twelve years of his life, Dickens managed to contain the gossip. After his death, surviving family members did the same. But when the author's last living son died in 1934, there was no one to discourage rampant speculation. Dramatic revelations came from every corner&#x2014;over Nelly's role as Dickens's mistress, their clandestine meetings, and even about his possibly fathering an illegitimate child by her.</p><p>This book presents the most complete account of the scandal and ensuing cover-up ever published. Drawing on the author's letters and other archival sources not previously available, Dickens scholar Michael Slater investigates what Dickens did or may have done, then traces the way the scandal was elaborated over succeeding generations. Slater shows how various writers concocted outlandish yet plausible theories while newspapers and book publishers vied for sensational revelations. With its tale of intrigue and a&nbsp;cast of well-known figures from Thackeray and Shaw to Orwell and Edmund Wilson, this engaging book will delight not only Dickens fans but also readers who appreciate tales of mystery, cover-up, and clever detection.</p></p><p><p><b>Michael Slater</b> is emeritus professor of Victorian literature at Birkbeck College, University of London; past president of the International Dickens Fellowship and of the Dickens Society of America; and author of <i>Charles Dickens</i>.

Goes beyond the traditional exercises that examine measurements, mineral, rocks, latitude and longitude, topographic maps, Earth-sun relations, etc. For anyone interested in geology or geography.</p><p>A comprehensive collection of college-level laboratory exercises that examine the basic principles and concepts of introductory earth science. Class tested exercises develop hypotheses based on observation, and make comparisons with experimental data. An Instructor&#39;s Manual is available.<p> Earth is a very small part of a vast universe, but it is our home. It provides the resources to carry on a modern society and the ingredients necessary to support life. Therefore, a knowledge and understanding of our planet is critical to our economic and social welfare and, indeed, vital to our survival. </p> <p> In recent years, media reports have made us increasingly aware of our place in the universe and the forces at work in our physical environment, as well as how human interaction with natural systems can often upset a delicate equilibrium. News stories inform us of new discoveries in the solar system and beyond. Daily reports remind us of the destruction created by hurricanes, flooding, mudflows, and earthquakes. We have been made aware of the depletion of ozone, an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere caused by human activities, and growing environmental concerns over the fate of the oceans. To comprehend, prepare for, and solve these and other concerns requires a full awareness of how science is done and the scientific principles that govern the operation of Earth. </p> <p> To achieve scientific understanding requires not only a knowledge and appreciation of broad scientific theories but also the ability to gather scientific data and to solve problems creatively with critical reasoning skills. As part of the educational process, laboratory experience is essential to developing these competencies. In the laboratory, nature can be explored, principles examined, and hypotheses developed, tested, and compared with experimental data. It is often in the laboratory that understanding begins. </p> <p> <i>Applications and Investigations in Earth Science</i> is an introductory-level laboratory manual consisting of twenty-two exercises designed to examine many of the basic principles of geology, meteorology, oceanography, and astronomy. The format of each of the exercises is the same. Each investigation includes </p> <ul> <li> <b>Statement of Purpose</b> that outlines the major topics) to be investigated in the exercise.</li> <li> <b>Objectives</b> that clearly state what should be learned by completing the exercise.</li> <li> <b>Materials</b> other than the text, paper, and pencil that are needed and supplied by the student. Also indicated are those materials that are supplied by the instructor and should be located in the laboratory.</li> <li> <b>Terms</b> are the key words that are shown in bold type in order of appearance in the exercise. In some cases the terms are defined within the exercise. Those that are not defined can be located in the text and/or class notes.</li> <li> <b>Introduction</b> that briefly discusses the material to be investigated. In most instances, a more detailed discussion can be found in the appropriate chapter of the text. This material should be read and reviewed prior to beginning the exercise.</li> <li> <b>Questions and Problems</b> that investigate and apply the principles examined in the exercise. The questions require various levels of understanding and build from basic comprehension to more demanding applications. When necessary, adequate space has been provided after each question so that the answer can be recorded for future reference.</li> <li> <b>Investigations using the Internet</b> explores the vast World Wide Web (WWW) of resources that are available to conduct both historical and real-time Earth science studies. These web-based activities are found on the manual's companion web site located at <b>http://prenhall.com/earthsciencelab</b> .</li> <li> <b>Review</b> that systematically presents the main points of the exercise that have been investigated and developed.</li> <li> <b>Summary/Report Page</b> located at the end of each exercise to be filled out after each exercise is completed. Most of the information requested will have been examined and answered in the exercise. Your laboratory instructor may require that a copy of the Summary/Report page be submitted for evaluation.</li> </ul> <p> <b> <i>A Note to the Student.</i></b><i> </i> The purpose of <i>Applications and Investigations in Earth Science</i> is to assist you in understanding the basic concepts of Earth science that are presented in most introductory courses by providing the experience of participation. Often, simply being told that something is true is not enough. However, the opportunity to collect facts, examine information, and draw conclusions in a scientific manner frequently results in comprehension. Learning is much more than the accumulation of knowledge; it is also the understanding that comes from "doing." In the laboratory we hope you will refine the critical and creative thinking skills that are vital to your effective participation in a modern society. </p> <p> Each of the manual's exercises is self-contained and will require approximately two hours to complete. However, your instructor may not follow the exercises in the order presented in the manual. Also, exercises may be assigned for completion <i>outside</i> of the regularly scheduled laboratory session. </p> <p> Prior to beginning each exercise you should </p> <ol> <li>Read the required text assignment, paying particular attention to the key terms that are listed in the exercise.</li> <li>Examine the exercise and read the purpose and list of objectives.</li> <li>Gather any additional materials listed at the beginning of the exercise. Bring these materials along with your laboratory manual, text, course notes, paper, and pencils to the laboratory session.</li> </ol> <p> After you have completed each exercise, </p> <ol> <li>Examine the review at the end of the exercise.</li> <li>Complete the Summary/Report page at the end of the exercise. Your instructor may require that you submit this report for evaluation by a specified date.</li> </ol> <p> <b> <i>A Note to the Instructor.</i></b><i> </i> <i>Applications and Investigations in Earth Science</i> is designed to supplement an introductory general education Earth science course. We have attempted to include a general survey of most of the major topics in Earth science, building upon questions that require various levels of understanding to answer. The first type of question is concerned with the basic concepts and fundamental principles of Earth science. These can be answered by reflective thought and careful reading of class notes and textbook materials. Other sections involve conducting experiments, gathering data, and drawing conclusions. The third type of investigation entails the application of principles to achieve solutions. </p> <p> In addition to adding several new and revised figures and exercise enhancements, this fourth edition of <i>Applications and Investigations in Earth Science</i> includes an <b>Investigating the Internet</b> section with each of the exercises. By accessing the manual's online companion web site at <b>http://prenhall.com/earthsciencelab</b> students will be presented with several challenging web-based activities that use World Wide Web resources to reinforce and extent the topics presented in each exercise. We recommend that these web-based activities be examined after the main body of the exercise has been completed. For those with limited time and/or resources, the entire section may be assigned as an out-of-class activity or omitted entirely. To facilitate grading, students may either download and submit the activity response form provided with each exercise or, at the discretion of the instructor, submit their answers electronically directly to any email address provided. Additional information and Internet links to Earth Science topics can be explored on the Internet at the <i>Earth Science,</i> 10th edition textbook site, <b>http://www.prenhall.com/tarbuck/</b> . </p> <p> To assist you in organizing your course, we have included in the <i>Instructor's Manual for Applications and Investigations in Earth Science</i> a table that cross-references each of the manual's twenty-two exercises with the appropriate chapters) in several of the current Earth science textbooks. The texts that have been cross-referenced include <i>Earth Science</i> (9th and 10th editions) by Tarbuck and Lutgens, and <i>Foundations of Earth Science</i> (third edition) by Lutgens and Tarbuck. </p> <p> Recognizing that different aspects of Earth science are emphasized by each of us, we have included exercises that cover a wide variety of subjects. Since each exercise is basically self-contained and covers a specific topic, individual exercises or whole units may be omitted or introduced in a different sequence without difficulty. Furthermore, with only minor modification, several exercises, or portions of exercises, may be assigned for completion outside the regularly scheduled laboratory sessions. </p> <p> The last two exercises in the manual investigate the basic skills of determining location and distance on Earth, working with the metric system, and conducting a scientific inquiry. Should you decide that completing all, or any part, of these exercises would be of benefit to your students, we suggest that you introduce them near the beginning of the course. In addition, Exercise Seventeen, "Astronomical Observations," will take the student several weeks to complete. </p> <p> Many of the exercises require that equipment and materials be supplied and present in the laboratory. When needed, a general list has been included at the beginning of each exercise. Realizing that some laboratory settings have limited access to materials such as minerals, rocks, and fossils, we have left the specific choices of these specimens to the instructor. </p> <p> In summary, we have attempted to put together a versatile and adaptable collection of laboratory experiences that investigate many of the topics in introductory Earth science. We sincerely feel that each exercise has merit and, through active student participation, the learning process is carried one step closer to complete understanding. </p></p><h2>The Rider on the White Horse</h2><p>The Rider of the White Horse is a classic German novella, in which the individual wrestles with the mass, the man with the most elementary forces of nature. The scene of the novella is characterized with vividness in its setting of marsh and sea, it glorifies love, and at the same time it touches themes which deeply occupied Storm, such as the problem of heredity or the relation between father and son.

Tour.</p><p>A glossy collection of 200 astounding pictures showcases Hubble's revelations since astronauts repaired the telescope in 1993. No longer are stars featureless points of light, galaxies fuzzy whirls, or nebulae murky clouds of color. Detail transforms the objects into convulsive, agitated tableaux of cosmic birth and death. In the immediate neighborhood, the telescope enables a steadier observation of the planets than can fly-by spacecraft (spectacularly so in the case of last year's Jupiter-comet collision), and the authors open with a gallery of the solar system. Their text strives to excite as much as the pictures do, and does that well enough for readers who have never heard how hot Venus is or must have the concept of the light-year explained. From such rudiments, the eye rushes to the images of startling discoveries: protoplanetary disks around new stars or the still-expanding fireball of a 10,000-year-old supernova. Expect certain interest in these awesome photos, and perhaps back it with <i>The Hubble Wars</i> by Eric Chaisson , the technical story of the telescope. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i>Barbree, coauthor of Moonshot (LJ 4/15/94) and a TV space journalist, and science fiction novelist Caidin survey the universe as seen by modern astronomers. Their prose is lush, and the color photographs are beautiful. After opening with an account of the initial failure of the Hubble optical system and its repair by a skilled and daring team of astronauts, the authors drift away from the Hubble story for whole chapters at a time; the text and the photos are derived from many sources, not just the Hubble Telescope. Compared with Carolyn Peterson's Hubble Vision (LJ 11/15/95), this new book is far more readable for the general public, but it gives far less scientific and technical detail and tells disappointingly less about the Hubble Telescope's work.

They focus on the unique strengths of economic anthropology as a meeting place for symbolic and materialist approaches and for understanding human beings as both practical and cultural.

Given the daunting task of building ships faster than they were being sunk, shipbuilding firms across the country found new ways to increase their efficiency and scale of production. Huge new shipyards were built, a labor force of 640,000 was employed, and over 55 million deadweight tons of ocean-going ships were delivered, including the famous Liberty and Victory ships. First published in 1951, <i>Ships for Victory</i> chronicles this remarkable wartime program in magisterial detail: the development of revolutionary construction methods; the upheavals in management, awarding of contracts, and allocation of steel and other materials; the recruitment, training, housing, and union activities of the workers; the crises, confusions, and scandals that arose; and the role of shipbuilding within the total war effort.</p></p><p>"Tells the story of the gigantic task accomplished by American shipyards during World War II . . .

The author first introduces readers to deontological (legalistic), antinomian (unprincipled) and teleological (situational) approaches to ethical reasoning. He then proceeds to explain why, in virtually every instance, none of these approaches alone fully addresses every ethical issue. Instead of providing answers, however, the author challenges his readers to consider their options completely when determining their professional behaviors. This well-respected art practitioner and educator refers often to the standards and procedures established within the art therapy profession. He suggests, however, that therapists should frequently view even these standards only as guidelines as when engaging in their chosen professional arena. This work is filled with clinical vignettes and case illustrations that present ethical dilemmas, followed by thought-provoking discussion questions. Additionally, readers are given ongoing opportunities to engage with these issues through metacognitive, kinetic, and sensory activities. Topics that the author presents include therapists&#x2019; responsibilities to their clients and the work place; rights of artworks; the art therapist as an artist, therapist, and human being; professional supervision; maintaining professional boundaries; responsibilities to research and to the profession; dealing with ethical violations; advertising; private practice; and potential multicultural and diversity issues.</p><p></p><h2>Cognitive Therapy of Substance Abuse</h2><p>Cognitive therapy offers a well-documented and cost-effective psychosocial treatment model for working with substance abuse disorders. Comprehensive and accessible, this volume clearly details the cognitive model of addiction, the specifics of case formulation, management of the therapeutic relationship, and the structure of the therapy sessions. It discusses how to educate patients in the treatment model and procedures and manage their cravings and urges for drugs and alcohol. Specific cognitive and behavioral strategies and techniques are described in detail, as are methods for understanding and working with patients who present concomitant problems of depression, anxiety, low frustration tolerance, anger, and personality disorders. Also addressed are such significant issues as crisis management and relapse prevention. Enhancing the utility of the volume are appendices featuring sample client inventories and checklists. These forms are designed to help the clinician identify targets for intervention, track progress over time, and develop an individualized relapse prevention plan for each client. <br></p><p>Cognitive Therapy of Substance Abuse was written in response to the ever-growing need to formulate and test cost-effective treatments for substance abuse disorders. Representing a major advance for meeting this pressing need, cognitive therapy offers a well-documented and demonstrably efficacious psychosocial treatment model. Emanating from the research and practical experience of Aaron T. Beck and his colleagues, this book demonstrates how cognitive therapy can be easily replicated by therapists and counselors alike. Comprehensive and accessible, this volume clearly details the cognitive model of substance abuse, the specifics of case formulation, management of the therapeutic relationship, and the structure of the therapy sessions. It discusses how to educate patients in the treatment model and manage their cravings for drugs and alcohol. Specific cognitive and behavioral strategies and techniques are described in detail, as is the management of acute crises and chronic problems in patients&#39; lives. Methods for understanding and working with such patients who present concomitant problems of depression, anxiety low frustration tolerance, anger, and personality disorders are spelled out in detail. Chapters also address such significant topics as managing relapse and strategies for relapse prevention. Unlike the many works that focus on theory and epidemiology, this volume concentrates on clinical procedures in a way that is both teachable and testable. An ideal treatment manual that can be utilized independently, or in conjunction with psychopharmacological or 12-step programs, Cognitive Therapy of Substance Abuse will be valued by all mental health practitioners who work with substanceabusers, regardless of their orientation or the extent of their previous experience with either cognitive therapy or substance abuse.Aaron T.

Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.The Red Badge of Courage was published in 1895, when its author, an impoverished writer living a bohemian life in New York, was only twenty-three. It immediately became a bestseller, and Stephen Crane became famous. Crane set out to create "a psychological portrayal of fear." Henry Fleming, a Union Army volunteer in the Civil War, thinks "that perhaps in a battle he might run....As far as war was concerned he knew nothing of himself." And he does run in his first battle, full of fear and then remorse. He encounters a grotesquely rotting corpse propped against a tree, and a column of wounded men, one of whom is a friend who dies horribly in front of him. Fleming receives his own "red badge" when a fellow soldier hits him in the head with a gun. "The idea of falling like heroes on ceremonial battlefields," Ford Madox Ford remarked later, "was gone forever."

Daughan&#x2019;s magnificently detailed account of the Battle of Lexington and Concord challenges the prevailing narrative of the American War of Independence. It was, Daughan argues, based as much in economic concerns as political ones. When Massachusetts militiamen turned out in overwhelming numbers to fight the British, they believed they were fighting for their farms and livelihoods, as well as for liberty.</p><p>Benjamin Franklin was not surprised by this widespread belief. In the years prior to the Revolution, Franklin had toured Great Britain and witnessed the wretched living conditions of the king&#x2019;s subjects. They wore rags for clothes, went barefoot, and had little to eat. They were not citizens, but serfs. Franklin described the appalling situation in a number of letters home. In the eyes of many American colonists, Britain&#x2019;s repressive measures were not seen simply as an effort to reestablish political control of the colonies, but also as a means to reduce the prosperous colonists themselves to the serfdom described in the Franklin letters.</p><p>Another key factor in the outcome of this historic battle, according to Daughan, was the scorn British officers had for colonial fighters. Although the British officers had fought alongside colonial Americans in the ferocious French and Indian War, they failed to anticipate the skill, organization, and sheer numbers of the colonial militias. Daughan explains how British arrogance led them to defeat at the hands of motivated, experienced patriot fighters determined to protect their way of life.</p><p>Authoritative and immersive, <em>Lexington and Concord</em> gives us a new understanding of a battle that became a template for colonial uprisings in later centuries.</p> 3 maps</p><p>George C. Daughan holds a PhD from Harvard University, where he studied under Henry Kissinger. One of his previous books, If By Sea, won the Samuel Eliot Morison Award for Naval Literature, and he has been honored with the Samuel Eliot Morison Award from the USS Constitution Museum for his work as a naval scholar. He lives in New Hampshire.&#x201c;This is hardly a new story, but Daughan imbues it with added nuances of character and motivation...A wonderful addition to the literature on the American Revolution, full of enlightening facts and figures.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews (starred review)</em></strong></p><h2>Evergreen Review Reader, 1967-1973</h2><p>From its first issue in 1957 to its final in 1973, Evergreen Review was hailed as one of the most provocative magazines ever.

Edited by Evergreen&#39;s founder and publisher, Barney Rosset, this selection represents the best of the magazine&#39;s final years - 1967 through 1973 - a politically and socially tumultuous time that included such pivotal events as the assassinations of Robert Kennedy, Malcolm X, and Che Guevara, the Democratic Convention in Chicago, and the massacre at Mylai. Complete with 100 photographs from the original magazine, Evergreen Review Reader has the historical relevance and literary muscle to speak to a new generation.</p><p>The Black Man Is Making New Gods <i>by Amiri Baraka</i><br> Black People! <i>by Amiri Baraka</i><br> Leroy <i>by Amiri Baraka</i><br> Listening To Sonny Rollins At The Five-spot <i>by Paul Blackburn</i><br> September, 1903 <i>by Constantine P.

Rosset was sole editor of the Evergreen Review throughout its 15-year life, displaying an amazing range. Writers were drawn to his commitment; for famous writers, Evergreen also offered the opportunity to experiment, as evidenced here by a Tom Stoppard short story and poems from Pete Hamil and Tennessee Williams (this one a gem). The nonfiction includes an essay by Vivian Gornick, an interview with John Cassavetes and firsthand reports from Vietnam, the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago and the Columbia University riots. In addition to fiction and plays, there is poetry by everyone from Karl Shapiro and Muriel Rukeyser to Baraka, Ginsberg and Bukowski. A broad range of international writers are represented, some who would go on to much greater fame: Jean Genet, Cesar Vallejo, Kenzaburo Oe, Vaclav Havel. Finally, there are reprints of key texts by Castro, Guevera and Malcolm X?and even Woody Allen's guerrilla satire, "Diary of a Revolutionary." Rosset consistently drew controversy?the Evergreen offices were bombed by anti-Castro militants in 1968, occupied by unionists and feminist activists in 1970 and even targeted by the CIA?but he never backed down. Rosset and his publications did get their due, however, when, in 1988, Grove and Evergreen were awarded the PEN biennial Publisher's Citation for fostering "the freedom and dignity of artists." This sprawling anthology clearly demonstrates that Evergreen's epoch-making achievement in literature justifies such recognition. (Feb.)

The stories were first published in magazines in 1893&#x2013;94. The original publications contain illustrations, some by Rudyard's father, John Lockwood Kipling. Kipling was born in India and spent the first six years of his childhood there. After about ten years in England, he went back to India and worked there for about six-and-a-half years. These stories were written when Kipling lived in Vermont. There is evidence that it was written for his daughter Josephine, who died in 1899 aged six, after a rare first edition of the book with a poignant handwritten note by the author to his young daughter was discovered at the National Trust's Wimpole Hall in Cambridgeshire in 2010. The tales in the book (and also those in The Second Jungle Book which followed in 1895, and which includes five further stories about Mowgli) are fables, using animals in an anthropomorphic manner to give moral lessons. The verses of The Law of the Jungle, for example, lay down rules for the safety of individuals, families and communities. Kipling put in them nearly everything he knew or "heard or dreamed about the Indian jungle." Other readers have interpreted the work as allegories of the politics and society of the time. The best-known of them are the three stories revolving around the adventures of an abandoned "man cub" Mowgli who is raised by wolves in the Indian jungle. The most famous of the other stories are probably "Rikki-Tikki-Tavi", the story of a heroic mongoose, and "Toomai of the Elephants", the tale of a young elephant-handler. As with much of Kipling's work, each of the stories is preceded by a piece of verse, and succeeded by another.</p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M.

Government-funded psychological warfare programs underwrote the academic triumph of preconceptions about communication that persist today in communication studies, advertising research, and in counterinsurgency operations. <br> <br> Christopher Simpson contends that it is unlikely that communication research could have emerged into its present form without regular transfusions of money from U.S military, intelligence, and propaganda agencies during the Cold War. These agencies saw mass communication as an instrument for persuading or dominating targeted groups in the United States and abroad; as a tool for improving military operations; and perhaps most fundamentally, as a means to extend the U.S. influence more widely than ever before at a relatively modest cost. Communication research, in turn, became for a time the preferred method for testing and developing such techniques. <em>Science of Coercion</em> uses long-classified documents to probe the contributions made by prominent mass communication researchers such as Wilbur Schramm, Ithiel de Sola Pool, and others, then details the impact of psychological warfare projects on widely held preconceptions about social science and the nature of communication itself. <br> <br> A fascinating case study in the history of science and the sociology of knowledge, <em>Science of Coercion</em> offers valuable insights into the dynamics of ideology and the social psychology of communication.</p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em><br><strong>Christopher Simpson</strong> is Assistant Professor of Communications at American University.

In Greece, Sparta attained maturity as the leader of a military coalition and Athens passed through a period of enlightened tyranny to a moderate democracy of dynamic energy and intelligence. Given the contrast between Greek idealism and Persian absolutism a clash between the two empires was inevitable. Important chapters deal with the revolt of Ionian Greeks against the Persians, and the two Persian invasions of Greece including epic battles at Marathon, Tthermopylae, and Salamis.

She first picked up the drumsticks and started making music at the precocious age of three, taught by her legendary father, percussionist Pete Escovedo. As the goddaughter of Tito Puente, music was the heartbeat of her family, and despite Sheila's impoverished childhood in Oakland, California, her family stayed strong, inspired by the music they played nightly in their living room. When she was only five, Sheila delivered her first solo performance to a live audience. By nineteen, she had fallen in love with Carlos Santana. By twenty-one, she met Prince at one of her concerts. Sheila E. and Prince would eventually join forces and collaborate for more than two decades, creating hits that catapulted Sheila to her own pop superstardom.<br> <br> <i>The Beat of My Own Drum</i> is both a walk through four decades of Latin and pop music&#x2014;from her tours with Marvin Gaye, Lionel Richie, Prince, and Ringo Starr to her own solo career. At the same time, it&#x2019;s also a heartbreaking, ultimately redemptive look at how the sanctity of music can save a person&#x2019;s life. Having repeatedly endured sexual abuse as a child, Sheila credits her parents, music, and God with giving her the will to carry on and to build a lasting legacy.<br> <br> Rich in musical detail, pop, and Latin music history, this is a fascinating walk through some of the biggest moments in music from the &#x2019;70s and &#x2019;80s. But as Sheila&#x2019;s personal story, this memoir is a unique glimpse into a world-famous drummer&#x2019;s singular life&#x2014;a treat for both new and longtime fans of Sheila E. And above all, <i>The Beat of My Own Drum</i> is a testament to how the positive power of music has fueled Sheila&#x2019;s heart and soul&#x2014;and how it can transform your life as well.</p><p>Emmy and Grammy Award&#x2013;nominee Sheila E. is one of the most talented percussionist/drummers in the world. She became a top session and touring musician before the age of twenty, performing and/or recording with George Duke, Herbie Hancock, Billy Cobham, Con Funk Shun, and countless others. She later performed with Marvin Gaye on his final world tour, Diana Ross, Lionel Richie, Prince, Gloria Estefan, Babyface, Patti LaBelle, and Stevie Nicks, among others. In the 1980s, Sheila became a pop sensation with her hits &#x201c;The Glamorous Life&#x201d; and &#x201c;A Love Bizarre.&#x201d; Sheila founded the Elevate Hope Foundation and cofounded Elevate Oakland, both of which focus on the needs of victims of child abuse by promoting music as an alternative form of therapy and serving public schools with music and the arts.<br><br>Wendy Holden is the author of more than thirty books, nine of which were international bestsellers. She also worked as a journalist for eighteen years.The Beat of My Own Drum 1. Crescendo<p></p> The loudest point reached in a gradually increasing sound<p></p> <br>You came into my life<br> <br>In time<br> <br>That moment I knew<br> <br>We would share our dreams<br> <br>And so it seems<br> <br>That dreams do come true<br> <br>&#x201c;NINA&#x201d;<br> <br>THE E FAMILY (WRITTEN BY PETE ESCOVEDO)<br> <br>I could hear the beat as I approached the stage. The connection between the music and me felt like it was in my DNA. The cymbals vibrated through my body and the timbales shook my bones. My father&#x2019;s conga playing touched me somewhere deep within my soul.<br> <br>&#x201c;You were kicking in time to the percussion inside your mom&#x2019;s belly!&#x201d; he&#x2019;d tell me with a chuckle. &#x201c;After you were born I took you to clubs in a bassinet and hid you behind the bar!&#x201d;<br> <br>It was no wonder that the pounding of his drums felt like the heartbeat of my life.<br> <br>The preparations for my first live performance that night in 1962 had taken more than an hour at my grandparents&#x2019; house on Thirty-third and Market Street in West Oakland, California. Some of my older cousins had gathered around to watch, curious, as Moms dressed me up.<br> <br>I was five years old.<br> <br>When she helped me into a new white dress with a frilly lace hem, I knew that it had to be a special occasion. I only ever wore dresses for fancy events like birthday parties or going to church on Sundays.<br> <br>Mama&#x2014;my Creole grandmother, who was what they called &#x201c;light skin,&#x201d; with dyed black hair, stockings rolled to the knee, and never without her apron, sat rocking in her chair with a grin as Moms fixed my hair and tied a white ribbon into my almost shoulder-length curls.<br> <br>The prettier she made me look, the more my cousins complained. &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t fair,&#x201d; they whined. &#x201c;How come Sheila gets to go and we can&#x2019;t?&#x201d;<br> <br>My mother told them they weren&#x2019;t old enough to go to a nightclub. They must have been between six and ten years old.<br> <br>&#x201c;But she&#x2019;s younger than us!&#x201d; they protested in unison.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Moms countered quickly. &#x201c;But this is a special night&#x2014;Sheila&#x2019;s going to go perform with her father.&#x201d;<br> <br>I looked up into her face, wide-eyed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m gonna play with Daddy?&#x201d;<br> <br>She nodded.<br> <br>I smiled. I didn&#x2019;t feel fazed by the news at all. I played with Pops all the time at home, stepping up to his congas (with the help of a chair) and hammering out a rhythm with my tiny hands.<br> <br>Even when he wasn&#x2019;t around, I&#x2019;d create music from any thing&#x2014;beating on pots and pans, a window, a wall, a table, or my chest. Moms and Pops said that each time a Jiffy peanut-butter commercial came on TV, I&#x2019;d run to the old Zenith set (that looked like something from a spaceship) and tap on the screen in time to the rhythm. The tune had a melody and beat that captured my attention.<br> <br>Eventually, my persistence wore down the grown-ups. Pops and his friends would laughingly concede and let me join in one of their daily jamming sessions.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come and play, Sheila,&#x201d; they&#x2019;d say. I had no idea that many of them were famous musicians&#x2014;they were just Pops&#x2019;s friends&#x2014;and they didn&#x2019;t need to ask me twice. Sitting on the congas opposite my father, I&#x2019;d mimic his hand movements as if I was looking in a mirror. I&#x2019;d watch him practice, and I&#x2019;d practice along with him. I guess he&#x2019;d decided I was ready to go public.<br> <br>Moms folded over the ruffled lining of my white socks and slipped me into shiny patent leather shoes with silver buckles. They were uncomfortably new. I arched my feet to test their flexibility and winced a little when they pinched.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get ready and then we&#x2019;ll go,&#x201d; she told me, stroking my cheek with the back of her hand.<br> <br>I loved all the attention she was paying me.<br> <br>I loved that I was going to play with Pops.<br> <br>I loved that I didn&#x2019;t hurt anymore.<br> <br>Everything was still very muddled in my head, but that night she was getting me ready can&#x2019;t have been long after the Bad Thing happened.<br> <br>The thing nobody talked about.<br> <br>The thing that made me so sick inside.<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t realize it at the time, but letting me play with Pops and his Escovedo Brothers Latin Jazz Sextet must have been some kind of reward.<br> <br>Not that my parents chose to see it that way. &#x201c;You were a natural real young,&#x201d; they&#x2019;d say firmly. &#x201c;We just thought it would be fun for you to show everyone what you could do.&#x201d; Even now, more than fifty years later, they find what happened back then almost impossible to talk about.<br> <br>No matter what the reason for my first performance that night, it is true that a day never passed in our house without music being played. The words &#x201c;I want to be a musician&#x201d; never came from my mouth, though. I didn&#x2019;t even think about it.<br> <br>In fact, later on, once I&#x2019;d witnessed the first moon landings (which seemed almost impossible to believe), I had my heart set on becoming an astronaut. I was so excited by the idea; I wanted to know everything about space and the enormity of the universe. I wanted to learn to fly an aircraft. I wanted to fly to the moon. Being my mother&#x2019;s daughter, I didn&#x2019;t want to have to wait to be a grown-up to do it. Oh, no. I didn&#x2019;t want to be the first woman to step onto the lunar surface. I wanted to be the first little girl on the moon. Later, I switched ambitions and decided I&#x2019;d win an Olympic gold medal for running track. I had a clear vision in my head of crossing the finish line as the crowd roared, then standing on the podium as the national anthem was played, my medal heavy around my neck.<br> <br>It never occurred to me that I might not be able to do both, or either.<br> <br>The one thing that made me truly happy, though, was music. I loved every kind of music, from classical to Motown, and Latin jazz especially touched my heart. But whether I was listening to Pops practicing, tapping away to a Miles Davis record, or watching Karen Carpenter beating her drums, those were the times when I&#x2019;d close my eyes and lose myself&#x2014;not realizing that music was going to become my passion and my purpose.<br> <br>Those times were when I was able to forget.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t remember how we traveled to the venue of my first public performance that warm summer night, though we must have driven. I seem to recall Moms opening the back door of her car for me to get out, and frowning because there was already a crease in my new shoes.<br> <br>The historic Sweet&#x2019;s Ballroom in Oakland was several miles away from where we lived in an apartment we were soon to be kicked out of for not paying the rent. Not that I minded moving again one little bit&#x2014;I couldn&#x2019;t wait to get away from that house, which I was beginning to think was cursed.<br> <br>What I do recall about that night at Sweet&#x2019;s&#x2014;so vividly I can almost smell the cigarette smoke&#x2014;is holding Moms&#x2019;s hand as we climbed the grand staircase to where the music was playing.<br> <br>Being only five years old, I was still small, and my arm was fully extended as I gripped my mother&#x2019;s fingers. Moms looked so beautiful in her blouse and pants, with her hair teased up at the top. I felt as if I was in the presence of an angel that night. She seemed so light and luminous that I thought she might float away unless I held on tight.<br> <br>When we reached the top of the red-carpeted stairs, we turned left and faced an enormous art deco ballroom, complete with a high ceiling and polished hardwood floor.<br> <br>My eyes wide, I gazed around me in wonder.<br> <br>There was a balcony upstairs and plush banquette seating to the side. On the dance floor, hundreds of people were swaying to the music being played by a band way up front on a stage. Everyone looked so smartly dressed compared to the adults I usually saw hanging round our apartment wearing tie-dyed shirts and bell-bottom jeans.<br> <br>The music was very loud&#x2014;even louder than at home&#x2014;and the place was packed. The heat from all those bodies made me break out in a sweat as my heart began hammering a beat of its own against my rib cage and butterflies began dancing in my tummy.<br> <br>When the band stopped playing, there was an enthusiastic round of applause along with some loud whistling. Moms waved at Pops, and he yelled at someone on the stage, &#x201c;Juanita&#x2019;s here!&#x201d;<br> <br>The next part remains frozen in slow motion in my memory.<br> <br>Pops&#x2019;s voice boomed out of the speakers as he announced, &#x201c;Hey, ladies and gents, my wife has just arrived and is over by the entrance. My daughter Sheila&#x2019;s with her tonight, and she&#x2019;s going to come up and play for you, so I want you to give her a big Bay Area welcome, okay?&#x201d;<br> <br>As if by magic, everybody swiveled around to face us, and there was a thunderous clapping and stamping of feet. They all stepped aside to create a perfect polished pathway to the stage. It was like Moses parting the Red Sea.<br> <br>Everyone in that big old room seemed to gasp when they caught sight of how little I was. Men and women reached out to touch my head or pat me on the back, cooing &#x201c;Aaah!&#x201d; as Moms led me through a forest of legs.<br> <br>Straight ahead of me, the high stage was bathed in pretty colored lights. I spotted Uncle Coke sitting behind his timbales and my Uncle Phil on bass. Pops stood at the front, beaming down at me. As ever, he was dressed in a suit and tie, and I felt proud to have the smartest dad in the room.<br> <br>As Moms and I continued what felt like a royal procession, the crowd packed back in around us and shuffled forward too. When I turned to look behind me, I couldn&#x2019;t see the entrance anymore.<br> <br>Once we reached the stage, Moms scooped me up in her arms and lifted me into the air, my shiny shoes dangling for everyone to see. All eyes were on me as Pops took me from her and held my hand as he led me to where he&#x2019;d just been playing the congas. The crowd continued to cheer as he lifted me onto the chair so that I was standing on it.<br> <br>As soon as I was up on that stage, the butterflies in my stomach started to dance again. This was not a familiar setup for me. Although I was with Pops, my uncles, and our friends doing what we always did, I&#x2019;d never done it in front of an audience before.<br> <br>Under hot, bright lights I stood behind the congas and waited for my cue. I knew that all I had to do was let them start playing, find a gap, and join in. Like my father, I didn&#x2019;t read music. I just played by the instinct deep in my gut.<br> <br>I played from my heart.<br> <br>&#x201c;Go with what you feel, baby, okay?&#x201d; was the only instruction Pops gave me that night before signaling to the band. The song began, and after a few beats, so did I. Pops stayed close and I followed his lead. I don&#x2019;t recall what song it was&#x2014;all my focus was on Pops.<br> <br>I must have lost myself then, because I don&#x2019;t remember anything else after he counted me in. People tell me that I played&#x2014;I mean really played. With Pops&#x2019;s encouragement, I even launched into my first-ever solo. It was completely ad lib. And the audience went crazy.<br> <br>Moms stood right up front in the crowd, jumping up and down, clapping and yelling enthusiastically. She put four fingers in her mouth and whistled loudly. Creole by birth and by nature, the woman who&#x2019;d been born Juanita Marie Gardere had an indomitable spirit. She was the person who taught me that I could do anything, be anything&#x2014;survive anything. Having grown up with seven siblings who were stars at basketball, baseball, and running track, she learned early on how to be strong, stubborn, loud, and competitive.<br> <br>&#x201c;A girl can do everything and anything a boy can do, and don&#x2019;t you ever forget that!&#x201d; she&#x2019;d insist. We teased her that it was the Gardere part of her talking. Whichever genetic line that competitive, stubborn streak came down, Moms taught me that when it came to trying something new, I shouldn&#x2019;t be afraid. I hear her ever-present and always encouraging &#x201c;Amen!&#x201d; in my head, even now.<br> <br>So that night in Oakland was my night. It was my chance to shine. That was my moment to feel special. It was a reminder that I was part of something bigger and better than me&#x2014;or anything that had ever happened to me.<br> <br>I was blessed to have been born into an amazing family. We might not have been rich and we may occasionally have gone hungry, but we never went unloved. My parents weren&#x2019;t always able to face up to some of life&#x2019;s harsher realities, but on that night, they wanted me to know my talent and own it for the first time.<br> <br>As I closed my eyes and forgot about everything other than creating music, I blew that room away.<br> <br>I was no longer a five-year-old girl who&#x2019;d had something bad happen to her.<br> <br>I was Sheila Escovedo&#x2014;one day to be known as Sheila E.<br> <br>I was a musician.<br> <br>Years later, I asked Pops what he remembered of that gig. He paused, a twinkle in his eye. &#x201c;You played great,&#x201d; he said, a smile breaking out and wrinkling the skin around his eyes. &#x201c;Yep&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. That&#x2019;s what happened. You played loud and you played fast and the audience loved you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Being up on that stage with him at Sweet&#x2019;s marked the first night of the rest of my life. I didn&#x2019;t know it then, but it was the one that would eventually shape my entire career.<br> <br>That was when I realized that I&#x2019;d not only been given the gift of music, but that it was something that would eventually heal my wounds.<br> <br>Little did I know how powerful that healing would become&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><h2>Secularity and Science: What Scientists Around the World Really Think About Religion</h2><p>Do scientists see conflict between science and faith? Which cultural factors shape the attitudes of scientists toward religion? Can scientists help show us a way to build collaboration between scientific and religious communities, if such collaborations are even possible? <br><br>To answer these questions and more, the authors of <em>Secularity and Science: What Scientists Around the World Really Think About Religion</em> completed the most comprehensive international study of scientists' attitudes toward religion ever undertaken, surveying more than 20,000 scientists and conducting in-depth interviews with over 600 of them. From this wealth of data, the authors extract the real story of the relationship between science and religion in the lives of scientists around the world. The book makes four key claims: there are more religious scientists then we might think; religion and science overlap in scientific work; scientists - even atheist scientists - see spirituality in science; and finally, the idea that religion and science must conflict is primarily an invention of the West. Throughout, the book couples nationally representative survey data with captivating stories of individual scientists, whose experiences highlight these important themes in the data. <em>Secularity and Science</em> leaves inaccurate assumptions about science and religion behind, offering a new, more nuanced understanding of how science and religion interact and how they can be integrated for the common good.<br></p><p><br><strong>Elaine Howard Ecklund </strong>is Herbert S.

She teaches creative writing at Bard College in upstate New York.Davis (Break It Down, a story collection) plunges into fiction-as-catharsis in her absorbing and lucid first novel. The narrative is comprised of the unnamed narrator's memories of and reflections upon her ended love affair with a nameless man 13 years her junior; its history infiltrates the books she reads and translates, as well as the novel she is struggling to write, which is this novel. As she probes the moments and minutiae of their relationship, the man's identity fades, and he becomes material for her fiction: like a backward-spiraling track into memory, a labyrinthine sentence mimes the diminishing roar of his car when he leaves her. Scenes gather, dissolve and reassemble, as does the man's fragmented image, with impressions and facts seeping through the narrator's consciousness and dreams-the man's skin, hair, clothing, his charm and flaws, his lies and his library, the money he fails to repay. Avoiding the earthiness of dialogue, of which there is none, the narrator experiences much of the world as "floating" ("his essence floated inside me")-the man's anger, her own features in a mirror, another story wafting loose in a room where a book lies open. Bereft, she turns stalker and voyeur, searching for her lover (as for story material) through streets surreal and noir, peering into his room and the gas station where he works. Finally, a cup of bitter tea, offered in a bookstore, provides ritual closure to the story of her search for her lover, though "something continued, something not formed into any story." Despite Davis's writerly self-consciousness, her novel works as an aching love story recollected in tranquillity.

There he met with early Buddhist masters. <i>Greek Buddha</i> shows how their Early Buddhism shaped the philosophy of Pyrrho, the famous founder of Pyrrhonian scepticism in ancient Greece.</p><br><p>Christopher I. Beckwith traces the origins of a major tradition in Western philosophy to Gandhara, a country in Central Asia and northwestern India. He systematically examines the teachings and practices of Pyrrho and of Early Buddhism, including those preserved in testimonies by and about Pyrrho, in the report on Indian philosophy two decades later by the Seleucid ambassador Megasthenes, in the first-person edicts by the Indian king Devanampriya Priyadarsi referring to a popular variety of the Dharma in the early third century BC, and in Taoist echoes of Gautama's Dharma in Warring States China. Beckwith demonstrates how the teachings of Pyrrho agree closely with those of the Buddha Sakyamuni, "the Scythian Sage." In the process, he identifies eight distinct philosophical schools in ancient northwestern India and Central Asia, including Early Zoroastrianism, Early Brahmanism, and several forms of Early Buddhism. He then shows the influence that Pyrrho's brand of scepticism had on the evolution of Western thought, first in Antiquity, and later, during the Enlightenment, on the great philosopher and self-proclaimed Pyrrhonian, David Hume.</p><br><p><i>Greek Buddha</i> demonstrates that through Pyrrho, Early Buddhist thought had a major impact on Western philosophy.</p></p><p><p>"In <i>Greek Buddha</i>, Beckwith delves into the writings of the Ionian philosopher-skeptic Pyrrho. Beckwith's discoveries, set forth in this elegantly argued book, upend received truths on the philosophical geography of Eurasia. Even the nonspecialist will thrill as Beckwith carefully traces core teachings of Buddhism to the world of Greek thought. Here is a book that is as provocative in its method as in its conclusions.

Porter is President, Dean and Professor of New Testament, McMaster Divinity College, Canada.'The most comprehensive account of the language of the New Testament ever produced by British scholars.' <br>The Expository Times</p><h2>A Tramp Abroad (1880) (The Oxford Mark Twain)</h2><p><em>A Tramp Abroad</em>, published in 1880, is Mark Twain's second travel book, a sequel to his immensely popular <em>The Innocents Abroad</em>. Here Twain returns to Europe in the company, as Russell Banks puts it in his introduction, of a genial "goad, guide, and all-purpose straight man" modeled on his friend and real-life traveling companion, Joe Twitchell, who "plays Butch Cassidy to Twain's Sundance, Sancho to his Quixote." The eccentric journey they take through Germany, Switzerland, Italy, and other countries constantly veers into imaginative burlesques, exaggerations, tall tales, and humorous digressions, the most well known of which are the inimitable "Baker's Blue-Jay Yarn" and "The Awful German Language." The travelers gamely take in student duels, Wagnerian opera, and the works of the Old Masters; they travel by raft, train, and donkey cart, listen to folk legends and dreadful pianists, scale the Alps, and view cathedrals he found noble in their ugliness. But the sight that cheers them most is that of New York harbor on their return. <em>A Tramp Abroad</em>, Banks reminds us, celebrates two "American males clearly blessed with the gift of friendship, of giving it and of receiving and holding onto it."</p><p>Nearly nine decades after his death, Mark Twain remains an international icon. His white-maned, mustachioed image is instantly identifiable throughout the world, the very picture of probity and high spirits (which explains why he's become the poster boy for products as diverse as beer, billiard tables, sewing machines, pizza, and real estate). Perhaps more importantly, Twain's books have retained all their power to amuse and enrage. How is it possible for the creator of a 19th-century "boy's holiday book" (Twain's own description of <i>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</i>) to raise so many contemporary hackles? The answer is that Twain <i>is</i> a contemporary writer. Not, of course, from a chronological point of view--he was born in Missouri in 1835 and died in 1910 (having insisted that "annihilation has no terrors for me"). But Twain was the first writer to elevate the American vernacular to a high art. Sidestepping the starched-shirt diction of his peers, he created an idiom that resembled (but did not precisely duplicate) the wayward, slangy, ungrammatical music of American conversation. No serious reader of Twain will want to do without the <i>Oxford Mark Twain</i>. This 29-volume leviathan includes not only the major works but also a treasure trove of essays and short pieces, many of them unavailable for decades. Throw in the introductions to each volume (by such heavyweights as Toni Morrison, Kurt Vonnegut, Cynthia Ozick, Gore Vidal, George Plimpton, Bobbie Ann Mason, and Walter Mosley), as well as the original illustrations, and you've got the book bargain of the millennium.In "A Tramp Abroad, Mark Twain's unofficial sequel to "The Innocents Abroad, the author records his hilarious and diverse observations and insights while on a fifteen-month walking trip through Central Europe and the Alps. "Here you have Twain's inimitable mix," writes Dave Eggers in his Introduction, "of the folksy and the effortlessly erudite, his unshakable good sense and his legendary wit, his knack for the easy relation of a perfect anecdote, and some achingly beautiful nature writing." <br>This Modern Library Paperback Classic reproduces the text of the first American edition and features new explanatory notes and a critical Afterword by Kerry Driscoll, professor of English at Saint Joseph College in Connecticut.</p><h2>Last Great Australian Adventurer: Ben Carlin&#39;s Epic Journey Around the World by Amphibious Jeep</h2><p>In 1948, Ben Carlin set out from New York City with an audacious, lunatic plan to circumnavigate the world in an army surplus amphibious jeep called Half-Safe. Fuelled by cigarettes and adrenaline, the Australian army major pushed his fragile, claustrophobic vehicle through fierce Atlantic hurricanes, across uncharted North African desert, into dense South-East Asian jungle and over the icy dark swells of the North Pacific. It was a 50,000-mile roll of the dice that by all rights should have killed him. When Ben finally pulled into Times Square a decade later, he found himself alone and forgotten, his legacy little more than a wake of women and empty whiskey bottles. And the worst was yet to come. Was it all a fool&#x2019;s errand? Or a pure manifestation of spirit? Where does a dream end and an obsession begin? What&#x2019;s an acceptable cost to pay, and to what lengths will a person go not to be left with the haunting question: what if? The Last Great Australian Adventurer is the compelling account of Ben Carlin&#x2019;s attempt to make an enduring mark on the world at the twilight of the Golden Age of Adventure.</p><p><b>Gordon Bass</b> grew up in Texas but spent his childhood summers on excavations led by his father, George F.

Published by Key Curriculum Press.</p><p></p><h2>The Life of Schubert (Musical Lives)</h2><p>Franz Schubert&#39;s tragically short life was lived in one of Europe&#39;s most richly musical cities: a Vienna that worshipped Beethoven and where Rossini and Paganini drew crowds. Christopher Gibbs considers how and what Schubert composed, taking a fresh look at this misunderstood composer, particularly the unfolding of his professional career, his relationship to Beethoven, the growth of his reputation and public image and his darker side of drinking, depression and sexual ambiguity. This searching and sympathetic biography questions the customary sentimental clich�s and the recent revisionist views concerning this elusive genius.</p><p>Franz Schubert is a singularly undocumented composer. Direct accounts of his life are scarce, incomplete, and contradictory; even the memoirs of his closest friends, mostly written long after his death, reflect the writers more than the subject. His own surviving letters and diaries are often poignant, but sparse; it is in his music that he truly revealed himself. No wonder he has been the victim of endless speculation and rumor, leaving his image encrusted in fantasy, sentimentality, and condescension. Numerous serious, conscientious biographies have attempted to rectify this. Christopher Gibbs's excellent, informative, generously illustrated new study is a welcome addition. Gibbs has written and lectured widely on Schubert; his style is lucid, scholarly but not pedantic, and except for a stiff, ponderous beginning, flows with natural ease. <p> Gibbs focuses on some relatively unexplored areas, notably Beethoven's profound influence on Schubert, both personal and musical, though they never met. He also demolishes several popularly held misconceptions, showing, for example, that Schubert took an active part in promoting his own career, enjoyed frequent successes, and lived to see his fame begin to grow. Gibbs demonstrates that Schubert was by no means a "natural," untutored composer who simply shook melodies out of his sleeve, and that it was not his untimely death that caused so many works to remain "unfinished." Some of these refutations have already been offered by previous writers, but are well worth repeating. Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, in his splendid book <i>On the Trail of the Schubert Songs</i>, points out that Schubert's self-criticism often drove him to compose the same text several times, though unlike Beethoven he left no "sketchbooks that resemble battlefields." Hans G�l, in his <i>Franz Schubert and the Essence of Melody</i> (a beautiful book despite the clumsy title), suggests with a composer's empathetic insight that Schubert may have abandoned a work, like the C-major Piano Sonata, because he had modulated himself into a corner or hit a snag in the development, going on to something else while hoping for future inspiration. </p><p> Gibbs deserves special gratitude for attacking the credibility of the most recent Schubert scholarship, which claims to have uncovered evidence of heavy drinking, debauchery, and unbridled sensuality, both hetero- and homosexual, born and bred from Vienna's depraved climate, Schubert's hedonistic circle of friends, and his own allegedly immoral nature. These assertions reveal more about our own times and attitudes than about Schubert and his world. <i>--Edith Eisler</i></p>Christopher Gibbs takes a fresh look at this misunderstood composer, particularly the unfolding of his professional career, his relationship to Beethoven, the growth of his reputation and public image and the darker side of drinking, depression and sexual ambiguity.</p><h2>Principles of Engineering Geololgy and Geotechinics (Soil Mechanics &amp; Foundations Library)</h2><p>Children&#39;s scribbles on inside board, first end page and title page and last few empty pages and last end page.

Drawing on their previously unknown correspondence, Elzbieta Ettinger describes a relationship that lasted for more than half a century, a relationship that sheds startling light on both individuals, challenging our image of Heidegger as an austere and abstract thinker and of Arendt as a consummately independent and self-assured personality.<br>Arendt and Heidegger met in 1924 at the University of Marburg when Arendt, an eighteen-year-old German Jew, became a student of Heidegger, a thirty-five-year-old married man. They were lovers for about four years; separated for almost twenty years, during which time Heidegger became a Nazi and Arendt emigrated to the United States and involved herself with issues of political theory and philosophy; resumed their relationship in 1950 and in spite of its complexities remained close friends until Arendt's death in 1975. Ettinger provides engrossing details of this strange and tormented relationship. She shows how Heidegger used Arendt but also influenced her thought, how Arendt struggled to forgive Heidegger for his prominent involvement with the Nazis, and how Heidegger's love for Arendt and fascination with Nazism can be linked to his romantic predisposition.<br>A dramatic love story and a revealing look at the emotional lives of two intellectual giants, the book will fascinate anyone interested in the complexities of the human psyche.</p><p>Elzbieta Ettinger is professor of humanities at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.In 1924, Hannah Arendt, then an 18-year-old assimilated German Jew, fell in love with future Nazi Martin Heidegger, her 35-year-old married philosophy professor at the University of Marburg. Insecure, vulnerable Arendt, whose father died when she was seven, idealized Heidegger, who found in their four-year love affair a passionate physical and spiritual bond. Heidegger joined the Nazi Party and openly declared his support for Hitler in 1933; later that year, Arendt fled Germany and severed her ties with Heidegger. She went on to condemn fascism in The Origins of Totalitarianism, yet in 1950, encouraged by her second husband, Heinrich Bluecher, a German ex-communist and an admirer of Heidegger's philosophy, she resumed a friendship with her erstwhile lover, swallowing his lies that he was a helpless victim of malicious slander. As Massachusetts Institute of Technology humanities professor Ettinger shows in this revealing account of a strange mutual dependency that lasted until Arendt's death in 1975, Arendt became Heidegger's willing apologist despite mutual rancor, conflicting emotions and her branding of her former professor as a "potential murderer." <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Essentials of Real Estate Finance</h2><p>Containing in-depth and easy-to-understand coverage of the real estate finance industry, this classic text has trained over 100,000 real estate professionals.

Kara Swisher chronicles the surprising growth of the world's largest online service, an organization for which everything apparently went wrong. <p> The company has run into obstacles at every step of the way--partners who failed to give necessary support or who even turned hostile, and competition from a multitude of corporate Goliaths (including Bill Gates, who declared that he could either buy AOL or bury it). Worst of all, AOL has created a cascading sequence of operational and technical blunders, often offending or infuriating the people they most need to survive; yet the company still manages to dominate the online service industry.</p><p> Swisher speculates that one main factor enabled AOL to succeed against overwhelming odds: the superior vision of marketing executive Steve Case. While other online services focused on games, shopping, and business, AOL worked on building community and interpersonal contacts. This service proved valuable enough to outweigh the company's mistakes and misfortunes.</p><p> However, it is this same focus that has also brought on many of AOL's problems. Swisher describes AOL's struggles with the seamier side of online life--people who use the service for criminal activities and for discussing raunchy sexual issues. Swisher also discusses the problems that come with too much success, such as the overload of users that routinely slows down or completely crashes the system, the backlash on the Internet when masses of netiquette-challenged AOLers appeared in cliquish newsgroups, and the national outrage when a technical problem brought down the entire service for many hours.</p><p> With its cast of fascinating and quirky characters, including Steve Case, Bill Gates, Paul Allen, and Alexander Haig, <i>aol.com</i> is a captivating look at all the human, cultural, and sometimes just plain quixotic factors that created this unlikely giant. <i>--Elizabeth Lewis</i></p>Advance Praise for aol.com<br><br>"Kara Swisher's book could not be more timely.

From its 1882 founding by a handful of men from a small, predominantly Irish Catholic parish in New Haven, Connecticut, the Knights of Columbus has grown to an international brotherhood of nearly 2 million members across North America and throughout the world. Formed by Father Michael J. McGivney with the men of his parish, the new fraternal organization was committed to the principles of charity and unity, while supporting the faith and financial viability of its members and their families. From its earliest days, the organization made the case that one could be both a good Catholic and a true American citizen, pushing back against the religious discrimination that was all too common. It would soon grow into an organization whose members supported one another while also contributing to their parishes, their communities, their countries, and the world.<br><br>Lavishly illustrated with hundreds of beautiful photos, <i><strong>The Knights of Columbus</strong>: An Illustrated History</i> presents the story of this remarkable organization&#x2015;and the many ways in which it has helped individuals, while also helping shape American and world history at key moments. You will discover the Knights&#x2019; decisive contributions during times of disaster as far back as the San Francisco earthquake and fire of 1906 and as recently as Hurricanes Katrina, Sandy, and Harvey. The book presents K of C's very public resistance to the Ku Klux Klan and its message of hate in the 1920s&#x2015;just one example of the Knights&#x2019; stand against bigotry. Also featured is the Knights&#x2019; respect for the importance of education, as the group worked to rectify the historical inaccuracies of the nation&#x2019;s textbooks and narratives during the 1920s. That work would help to tell the previously overlooked stories of America&#x2019;s Catholics, African Americans, and Jews, among others. Also highlighted is the organization&#x2019;s active role in the fight for religious freedom throughout the world, from its involvement in ending the Mexican government&#x2019;s persecution of Catholics during the 1920s to its current work to end persecution of religious minorities in the Middle East and provide assistance for ISIS genocide survivors. K of C support for America&#x2019;s troops and veterans saw soldiers through two world wars and continues today.<br><br>In nearly a century and a half since its humble beginnings, the Knights of Columbus has touched the lives of countless individuals&#x2015;Catholic and non-Catholic&#x2015;in communities around the world. Through war and peace, it has remained the &#x201c;strong right arm of the Catholic Church,&#x201d; helping its neighbors next door and around the world with help and hope, faith and freedom.</p></p><p><p><strong><em>Andrew T.

Heart disease, autoimmune disease, diabetes, neurological conditions, cancer, Lyme disease&#x2015;the list goes on. The conventional, allopathic, treat-the-symptom-with-pharmaceutical-drugs model is rapidly falling out of favor as patients are searching for nontoxic, advanced prevention and healing modalities that actually work. <em>Bioregulatory Medicine</em> introduces a model that has proven effective for decades in other more forward-thinking developed countries, including Switzerland and Germany.</p> <p>Our bodies have many bioregulating systems,&nbsp;including the&nbsp;cardiovascular, digestive, neurological, respiratory, endocrine, and so on. Bioregulatory medicine is a comprehensive and holistic approach to health that advocates the use of natural healing methods to support and restore the body&#x2019;s intrinsic self-regulating and self-healing mechanisms, as opposed to simply treating symptoms with integrative therapies. Bioregulatory medicine is about discovering the root cause of disease and takes into account the entire person from a genetic, epigenetic, metabolic, energetic, and emotional point of view. So while patients may have the same disease or prognosis, the manifestation of illness is entirely bioindividual and must be treated and prevented on an individual level.</p> <p><em>Bioregulatory Medicine</em> addresses the four pillars of health&#x2015;drainage and detox, diet, mind-body medicine, and oral health&#x2015;using a sophisticated synthesis of the very best natural medicine with modern advances in technology. In addition to identifying the cause of disease, bioregulatory medicine promotes disease prevention and early intervention of illness through noninvasive diagnostics and treatments, and incorporates the use of over 100 different non-toxic diagnostics and treatments from around the world.</p> <p>Forward-thinking patients and integrative practitioners will find <em>Bioregulatory Medicine</em> invaluable as they seek to deepen their understanding of the body&#x2019;s many regulating systems and innate ability to heal itself.</p></p><p><p><strong>Dr. Dickson Thom, DDS, ND </strong>is one of the co-founders and medical directors of the American Center of Biological Medicine, has over forty years of experience as a clinician and over twenty years as a medical professor.

In this new and substantially expanded second edition, Jenkins continues to illuminate the remarkable expanion of Christianity in the global South--in Africa, Asia, and Latin America--as well as the clash betwen Islam and Christianity since September 11. Among the major topics covered are the growing schism between Northern and Southern churches over issues of gender and sexuality, immigrant and ethnic churches in North America, and a special section on the split within the Anglican Communion. The first in a three-book trilogy on the changes besetting modern Christianity, this award-winning book will be welcomed by all of those who have come to recognize Philip Jenkins as one of our leading commentators on religion and world affairs.</p><p>Philip Jenkins is Distinguished Professor of History and Religious Studies at Pennsylvania State University.*Starred Review* Fear of Islam is peaking, fueled by reports that the religion is burgeoning in numbers as well as militancy. Jenkins grants that Islam is indeed booming but marshals the evidence that today's largest religion, Christianity, will grow exponentially, too, and will remain the faith of the largest proportion of humanity. But the Christianity of 2050 will be very different from that molded by the 1,300 years during which Christianity was the faith of a rapidly developing Europe. The new Christianity will be liturgically anarchistic compared with the staid services of white, upper-middle-class people today. It will be overwhelmingly the faith of poor nonwhites living south of Europe, the U.S., and present-day Russia, and it won't reflect the values of the wealthy global north. It will revive Christianity's root emphases on healing and prophecy because its adherents will resemble the poor and oppressed who first embraced the redemption, the healing, and the blessing that Jesus promised. As he makes his case, Jenkins dispels some fashionable myths about historic Christianity; about historic Christian-Islamic relations; and about the nature of presumably pacific Hinduism when it is politicized. He also speculates trenchantly on how the problems of the Islamic and Christian global south will affect the global north, requiring genuine charity of the rich and genuine discernment of their leaders. A book everyone concerned about humanity's immediate future ought to read. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

But in this imaginative &#x201c;prequel&#x201d; to the play, John Updike makes a case for the royal couple that Shakespeare only hinted at. Gertrude and Claudius are seen afresh against a background of fond intentions and family dysfunction, on a stage darkened by the ominous shadow of a sullen, erratic, disaffected prince. &#x201c;I hoped to keep the texture light,&#x201d; Updike said of this novel, &#x201c;to move from the mists of Scandinavian legend into the daylight atmosphere of the Globe. I sought to narrate the romance that preceded the tragedy.&#x201d;</p></p><p>Borrowing a phrase from <i>Hamlet</i> for the title of his 1999 nonfiction collection, John Updike may perhaps have been dropping hints about his fictional work in progress. He has, in any case, now delivered <i>Gertrude and Claudius</i>--and his variation on what is arguably the Bard's greatest hit sits very handsomely in the Shakespearean shadows. As its title suggests, this is a prelude to the actual play, focusing not on the sulky star but on his mother and fratricidal stepfather (think of it as a Danish, death-struck version of <i>The Parent Trap</i>). Updike's great achievement here is to turn our customary sympathies on their heads. This time around, Gertrude is a decent, long-suffering wife, whose consciousness happens to be raised to the boiling point by her sexy brother-in-law. And Claudius, too, seems half a victim of this fatal attraction, with a strong neo-Platonic accent to his lust: <blockquote> The amused play of her mouth and eyes, the casual music of her considerate voice, a glimpse of her bare feet and rosy morning languor were to him amorous nutrition enough: at this delicate stage the image of more would have revolted him.... What we love, he understood from the poetry of Provence, where his restless freelancing had more than once taken him, is less the gift bestowed, the moon-mottled nakedness and wet-socketed submission, than the Heavenly graciousness of bestowal. </blockquote> Subtract the poetry (and leave in the wet-socket business) and we're not too far from Rabbit Angstrom. As in the bulk of his fiction--and most conspicuously in the underrated <i>In the Beauty of the Lilies</i>--Updike sacrifices artistic firepower when he goes archaic on us. That explains why <i>Gertrude and Claudius</i> gets off to a wobbly start, with the author's medieval diction careening all over the page. But once his narrative gets up to speed, Updike dispenses one brilliant bit of perception after another. Note, for example, Ophelia's teeth, "given an almost infantile roundness by her low, palely pink gums, and tilted very slightly inward, so her smile imparted a glimmering impression of coyness, with even something light-heartedly wanton about it." Who else could make mere dentition such a window into the soul? <p> <i>Gertrude and Claudius</i> also amounts to a running theological argument, in which men constantly impale themselves on metaphysical principle while the adulterous queen is willing "to accept the world at face value, as a miracle daily renewed." (That would explain Gertrude's snap diagnosis of her neurotic son: "Too much German philosophy.") A superlative satellite to Shakespeare's creation, Updike's novel is likely to retain a kind of subordinate rank, even within his own capacious body of work. Still, it's packed with enough post-Elizabethan insight about men and women, parents and children, to suggest that the play's <i>not</i> the thing--not always, anyway. <i>--James Marcus</i></p>"Precisely honed, buoyant with sly wit, masterful character analysis and astutely observed historical details, this tour de force by the protean Updike reimagines the circumstances leading to Shakepeare's <i>Hamlet</i>.... Updike details the irresistible sweep of their mutual passion and the mortal danger it entails with delicacy.... The resolution is breathtaking."<br>-- <i>Publishers Weekly</i> (starred)<br><p>"Its skitter of fireworks, as ingenious (and protracted) as any Updike has arranged, lights up the darkness over territory won in a lifelong literary engagement. The book illuminates questions about Shakespeare, about what a classic means and also the unexplored hills and forests that lie on either side of the path art pushes through them."<br>-- Richard Eder, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br></p><p>"Witty...fresh and moving...engrossing enough on its own terms to stand independently of Shakespeare's play"<br>-- Paul Gray, <i>Time</i> <br></p><p>"A living, powerfully physical work"<br>-- Brooke Allen, <i>Wall Street Journal</i><br></p><p>"Updike and Shakespeare: 'Tis a consummation devoutly to be wished."<br>-- Ron Charles, <i>Christian Science Monitor</i><br></p><p>"Updike has managed to create in Gertrude a genuinely compelling character, a woman who is, by turns, vulnerable and outspoken, daring and naive...One of his most sympathetic and persuasive female characters yet"<br>-- Michiko Kakutani, <i>New York Times</i><br></p><p>"Witty, elegantly wrought...absorbing in its own right as the story of an adulterous affair in a world where illicit love is far more perilous than it is in ours."<br>-- Howard Kissel, <i>Daily News</i><br></p><p>"You can feel Updike's pleasure and intellectual curiosity throughout this novel...There is something delightful about following Updike down this path, seeing his sentiments and sympathies unfold, watching him deftly handle the text of Hamlet and the spiritual ambiguities that surround it."<br>-- Gail Caldwell, <i>Boston Globe</i></p></p><h2>Fire in America!</h2><p>A comprehensive, pictorial and narrative history of America&#39;s greatest and most consequential fires, military uses of fire, and fire fighting practices, from the 1606 Jamestown fire to the firestorms of Vietnam</p><p></p><h2>Marks of Valor (Seals: The Warrior Breed, Book 6)</h2><p>The conflict in Vietnam has spread into Cambodia and Laos and the burden of fighting falls on the shoulders of the U.S. Navy SEALs.

Or people who sit under trees and wait to be struck on the head by apples? If so, then you owe it to yourself to explore the insights of this book. In conversational yet artful prose, James H. Hall reveals the many ways that you can actually enjoy and use philosophy in the course of your everyday experience. Doing philosophy involves critically examining key concepts, presuppositions and implications that are in play across the entire range of human inquiry. Practically Profound introduces the enterprise in three basic areas: knowledge and belief (epistemology), human nature (ontology) and the good life (ethics). Emphasizing experience-based arguments, the book demonstrates techniques that readers of all ages can use to enhance their own understanding of themselves and their world. This book is ideally suited to any introductory course in philosophy that takes a problems-based approach, as well as to general readers interested in putting philosophy to work in their everyday lives.</p><p>James H.

The Book, the ancient, infinite codex of the past, present and future, tells of a prophecy that will plunge Kelanna in that bloody war, but it requires a boy--Archer--and Sefia will stop at nothing to ensure his safety. The Guard has already stolen her mother, her father, and her Aunt Nin. Sefia would sooner die than let them take anymore from her--especially the boy she loves.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But escaping the Guard and the Book's prophecy is no easy task. After all, <i>what is written always comes to pass.</i> As Sefia and Archer watch Kelanna start to crumble to the Guard's will, they will have to choose between their love and joining a war that just might tear them apart. Full of magic, suspense, and mystery, Traci Chee brings her trilogy to a close in this spellbinding final installment.</p><p>Traci Chee is an all-around word geek, she loves book arts and art books, poetry and paper crafts. She studied literature and creative writing at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and earned a master of arts degree from San Francisco State University. Traci grew up in a small town with more cows than people, and now feels most at home in the mountains, scaling switchbacks and happening upon hidden highland lakes. She lives in California with her fast-fast dog. <i>The Storyteller</i> is the final book in the trilogy that began with the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller, <i>The Reader</i>.<b>Chapter One</b><br> <b>Fine as Gossamer, Hard as Iron</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Sefia sat up in the shadows of the sick bay, startled out of some half-remembered dream. <br> &nbsp;<br> The ship rocked and plunged beneath her, making the jars of ointment and bottles of tonic rattle on their shelves. Outside, rain spattered the portholes, blurring her view of the waves, high as rolling hills.<br> &nbsp;<br> A storm. They must have come upon it in the night.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sefia shivered, hugging her knees to her chest. In the four days since she'd returned to the <i>Current</i> with Archer, she'd had the same dream again and again. She was back in the house on the hill, and ink was seeping&#x2014;no, <i>flooding</i>&#x2014;from the secret room in the basement where her parents had kept the Book, the dark waves reaching across the floor to grasp them by the ankles and crawl up their calves. In the dream, Lon and Mareah scooped her up. In the dream, they shoved her out the door. But they were always too slow to save themselves, always too slow to escape the growing pool of ink that drew them, screaming, into its black depths. <br> &nbsp;<br> Destiny. Her parents had been destined to die young, their futures recorded in the Book with everything that had ever been or would ever be, from the flicker of a mayfly's wings to the life spans of the stars overhead. <br> &nbsp;<br> Somewhere in the Book was the passage where her mother got sick. <br> &nbsp;<br> Somewhere were the paragraphs that described her father being tortured.<br> &nbsp;<br> It had been written, so it had come to pass.<br> &nbsp;<br> But they'd fought it. They'd betrayed the Guard, the secret society of readers to which they'd sworn their undying allegiance. They'd stolen the Book, the Guard's most powerful weapon, to protect their daughter from her own future. They'd run.<br> &nbsp;<br> They'd lost, in the end, but oh, how they'd <i>fought</i>. <br> &nbsp;<br> As Sefia had to fight now. Fight and <i>win</i>, or she'd lose Archer to destiny too. <br> &nbsp;<br> Beside her, he lay curled beneath the blankets, hair tousled, fingers twitching in his sleep. He always slept so little, his dreams haunted by memories of the people he'd killed. <br> &nbsp;<br> He felt <i>fractured</i>, he'd told her. At all times, he was the same small-town boy he'd been before the Guard's impressors took him, and yet, at all times, he was an animal, he was a victim, he was a killer, he was loud as thunder, he was the boy from the legends, with a bloodlust that could not be slaked. <br> &nbsp;<br> Lightning forked in the distance, pulsing like veins in the restless sky.<br> &nbsp;<br> As if in response, Archer's body spasmed. He let out a wordless gasp.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sefia shifted out of his way. "Archer. It's okay. You're safe."<br> &nbsp;<br> His eyes opened. For a moment, he seemed to have trouble emerging from his dreams, seemed to have trouble recognizing where he was, <i>who</i> he was.<br> &nbsp;<br> But the moment would pass. It always did. And then&#x2014;<br> &nbsp;<br> The smile. It spread across his face like dawn racing over water&#x2014;his lips, his cheeks, his golden eyes. Every time, it was like he was seeing her for the first time, his expression full of such hope that she longed to see it again and again for the rest of her days. <br> &nbsp;<br> For a second, the storm abated. For a second, the ship was still. For a second, Sefia's whole world was light and soft and warm. <br> &nbsp;<br> "Sefia," he whispered, tucking her hair behind her ear. <br> &nbsp;<br> She bent closer, drawn to him as a hummingbird is drawn to a flower, her mouth gently landing on his. <br> He leaned into her kiss, responding to her lips and wandering hands as if her very touch was magic, making him moan and arch and yearn for more. <br> &nbsp;<br> He laced his fingers in her hair, like he needed to be closer to her, like he couldn't get enough of her, but as he tried to sit up, he let out a sudden hiss of pain and reached for his injured side. <br> &nbsp;<br> "I'm sorry," she said. <br> &nbsp;<br> "Don't be." Propping himself up on his elbows, he grinned. "I'm not." <br> &nbsp;<br> Her cheeks warmed as she pulled aside the blanket to examine his bandages. Doc had stitched and dressed the wound twice now: first when he'd arrived, half-conscious, with the gash below his ribs black and nauseatingly deep, and a second time when Archer had torn his sutures trying to help Cooky dump a pot of potato peels overboard. Sefia would never hear the end of it if Doc had to redo the stitches again. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> "I'm fine." Archer tried batting her away. <br> &nbsp;<br> "You almost died." <br> &nbsp;<br> "Only almost." He shrugged. He'd told her about the fight with Serakeen. There had been the smell of cordite and blood. A gust of magic that had swept Archer's lieutenants, Frey and Aljan, into the wall of the alley before dropping them, unconscious, onto the cobbles. The resistance of bone as Archer severed Serakeen's hand at the wrist. <br> &nbsp;<br> "I should've been there," Sefia said, not for the first time. If she'd been there, she could have protected him. She had the same magic as Serakeen&#x2014;a magic the Guard called Illumination&#x2014;she might have even matched him in a fight. <i>After all, she thought bitterly, I'm the daughter of an assassin and the most powerful sorcerer the world has seen in years.</i> <br> &nbsp;<br> No. She didn't want to believe in that future. She wouldn't become a weapon in some war for control of the Five Kingdoms. She wouldn't lose Archer, the boy she loved. <br> &nbsp;<br> "You're here now. That's what matters," Archer said quietly. "Without you, we wouldn't be able to rescue Frey and Aljan." <br> &nbsp;<br> His bloodletters, his <i>friends</i>, had followed him into the fight with Serakeen, and Serakeen still had them. The Guard's Apprentice Soldier, known to Sefia's parents as Rajar, had once been Lon and Mareah's friend and collaborator. Together, they'd orchestrated the war that was supposed to claim Archer's life. <br> &nbsp;<br> How many of her parents' mistakes would Sefia have to fix? She'd loved them, but they'd made <i>so many.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> "Frey and Aljan will be all right," Sefia said. <br> &nbsp;<br> "You really think so?" <br> &nbsp;<br> She trailed her fingers down his arm, over the fifteen burns that marked his kills in the impressors' fighting rings, and took his hand. "Yes," she said. <br> &nbsp;<br> The plan was to return to the bloodletters, organize a rescue, and meet up with the <i>Current of Faith</i> again at Haven, an island in the unexplored reaches of the Central Sea-one of those places you could get to only if you were told how to get there. Reed had set it up months ago to take in outlaws on the run from the widening scope of the war. If Sefia and Archer got there with the bloodletters, they would all have a place to wait while the fighting-and destiny-passed them by. If they got to Haven, Archer would live. <br> &nbsp;<br> But first, they needed the Book. Sefia couldn't teleport to the bloodletters without a clear image of where they were, and only the Book, with its infinite pages of history, could provide that. <br> &nbsp;<br> She'd hidden it in the safest place she could think of: the Jaharan messengers' post. The messengers' guild dealt in all kinds of secrets&#x2014;delicate packages, incriminating information&#x2014;and they never broke their trust. They were respected and powerful, and while it was with them, no one could touch the Book.<br> &nbsp;<br> Not even the Guard. She hoped.<br> &nbsp;<br> The <i>Current of Faith</i> was on its way to Jahara now; they were only a few days away. A few days, and she'd have the Book back. A few days, and she'd be able to find the bloodletters and mount a rescue. A few days. Frey and Aljan just had to hold on a few more days. <br> &nbsp;<br> Archer lifted Sefia's hand to his lips. "What would I do without you?" <br> &nbsp;<br> "You'll never have to find out." She kissed him again, and the kiss was a promise. A promise of high winds and open waters, of lying, legs tangled, on a white beach with nothing but the firmament for a coverlet, of succulent days and hot breath and damp skin and years rich as wine and endless as the sea.</p><h2>Centre Pompidou: Renzo Piano, Richard Rogers, and the Making of a Modern Monument (Great Architects/Great Buildings)</h2><p><b>A lively intellectual biography of one of the 20th century&#x2019;s most iconic buildings</b><br><br> The Centre Georges Pompidou, also called Beaubourg, is today considered an icon of contemporary Paris, the quintessence of a modern building, and a model for what a museum can be. In 1971, Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers, together with the engineering firm Ove Arup &amp; Partners, won an international architecture competition with their innovative and irreverent design. Completed in 1977, the building was at first received skeptically by critics, yet it was quickly embraced by the public as a beloved monument of the modern city of Paris. This lively intellectual biography of the building explores its history and the reasons for its success, from its genesis as a politically calculated response to Paris&#x2019;s turbulent 1968 student protests to the role played by architects in its construction, as well as the historical influences and the engineering solutions that inform its design. A key reason for the Centre Pompidou&#x2019;s success indeed lies in its ability to channel architectural memory, connecting it powerfully to Paris&#x2019;s historic urban fabric. This essential text on one of the twentieth century&#x2019;s most significant buildings is accompanied by a portfolio of rare drawings and photographs.&nbsp;</p><p>The history of Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers&#x2019;s iconic Centre Pompidou is explored in this absorbing, and beautifully illustrated, biography of a building.<br><b>Francesco Dal Co </b>is professor of history of architecture at the Istituto Universitario di Architettura Venezia (IUAV) and director of the architecture magazine <i>Casabella</i>.

Hieroglyphics begins to take on a lettering system in the form of an upper Kemetic Script known as Proto- Sinatic or Ancient Moabite/Cannanite from which the Greek, Roman, Latin and English Alphabet are derived. Ancient words that have been passed down through this script still hold the intrinsic meanings of those letters and have been preserved in secret societies for ages. These meanings are not present in modern dictionaries due to the morphing of language itself overtime. However, because the ancients either observed or affixed an inherent meaning to the letters and later formed word roots according to those meanings, we can access the ancient meaning of ancient words that have been passed down and have retained not only their inherent meaning but their general and common meanings. Thus it is with the word Moor.

"The Speech," as it has come to be known, helped launch Ronald Reagan as a leading force in the American conservative movement. However, less than twenty years earlier, Reagan was a prominent Hollywood liberal, the president of the Screen Actors Guild, and a fervent supporter of FDR and Harry Truman. While many agree that Reagan's anticommunism grew out of his experiences with the Hollywood communists of the late 1940s, the origins of his conservative ideology have remained obscure.<br><br>Based on a newly discovered collection of private papers as well as interviews and corporate documents, <i>The Education of Ronald Reagan</i> offers new insights into Reagan's ideological development and his political ascendancy.

This volume brings these pieces together. Jane Austen presents a satirical history of England, while Charles Dickens&#39; gory and dramatic history is full of villains and heroes.</p><p>Despite being only moderately successful in her lifetime, Jane Austen&#39;s six novels are famous throughout the world for their distinctive style and gripping plots. Her novels and stories are regularly adapted for theatre, film and television.Charles Dickens&#39;s memorable characters and strong narrative style means that his work has been loved for the last 200 hundred years - and none of his books have ever gone out of print.It's a truism that writers, like musicians, must practice their scales before they take flight. Are the practice lessons themselves of any literary value? Rarely, judging from these two volumes, other than as scholarly footnotes--although Jane Austen's The History of England, composed in 1791, when the future author of Pride and Prejudice was only 16, proves a happy exception. Though the 60-page manuscript has appeared previously in Austen collections (most recently in Oxford University Press's Catharine and Other Writings, 1993), it's never before been published in facsimile--an important point since Austen's handwritten manuscript was accompanied by profuse color portraits drawn by the writer's older sister, Cassandra, reproduced here. Intended to burlesque Oliver Goldsmith's wildly popular, four-volume The History of England from the Earliest Times to the Death of George II, Austen's little book, as A.S. Byatt points out in an introduction, displays ``an unusual mixture of lively energy and gleefully confident control''--as witnessed by this opening sentence to Austen's brief life of Henry V: ``This Prince after he succeeded to the throne/grew quite reformed and amiable, forsaking all his dissipated Companions, &amp; never thrashing Sir William again.'' That sort of dry, sophisticated wit abounds throughout, making this an esoteric pleasure. Generally less involving are most of the bits of juvenilia excavated by Paul Mandelbaum, a freelance journalist, in First Words. Arranged alphabetically by their 42 authors, from Isaac Asimov to Tobias Wolff, the entries include such items as Jill McCorkle's short-short ``The Night Santa Failed to Come,'' written when she was seven; eight-year-old Amy Tan's essay, ``What the Library Means to Me,'' and--far more polished--a long mystery story (``Untitled Mystery'') from 14-year-old John Updike. The collection makes clear that, even when very young, many writers work with ideas that will hallmark their adult work (e.g., Stephen King at age nine writing in ``Jhonathan and the Witchs'' [sic] of a quest confounded by supernatural evil), and Mandelbaum does an energetic job of pointing out, in introductions and sidebars, thematic relations between each author's older and newer writings--though his comments do sometimes sound almost tongue-in-cheek: ``The childhood piece that follows is precocious in its prose and is an early foray in [the author's] ongoing exploration of masculine terrain but doesn't quite anticipate his roles as literary philosopher and cultural provocateur''--this pronouncement applied to ten-year-old Norman Mailer's ``adventure epic,'' ``The Martian Invasion.'' Still, Mandelbaum's collection has a certain novelty interest and, for manic completists, it no doubt will prove a must. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

From his early years spray painting the walls of lower Manhattan to his first solo show in 1982 and his untimely death at the age of 27 in 1988, Jean-Michel Basquiat has become a symbol of the 1980s New York art scene. Now, more than a quarter-century since his death, this book considers Basquiat&#x2019;s works in light of their transformative power. Exquisitely reproduced full-page color illustrations of his paintings cover the full thematic range of Basquiat&#x2019;s work. From the autobiographical elements of Untitled (1981) and the powerful critique of racial justice that is Irony of a Negro Policeman to an exploration of black heroes, Untitled (1982) and the tongue-in-cheek social commentary of A Panel of Experts, Basquiat&#x2019;s limitless palette of observation, criticism, and cultural references endows his art with lasting and provocative power. Author Dieter Buchhart explores how Basquiat&#x2019;s success paved the way for an entire generation of black artists and how street culture has spread into popular culture. Texts by curators, art dealers, and cultural critics discuss the significance of Basquiat&#x2019;s oeuvre and show how his approach and subject matter continue to influence artists around the world.</p><p>Dieter Buchhart is a critic, art historian, and curator based in Vienna.

Why does humor exist in the first place? Why do we spend so much of our time passing on amusing anecdotes, making wisecracks, watching <i>The Simpsons</i>? In <i>Inside Jokes</i>, Matthew Hurley, Daniel Dennett, and Reginald Adams offer an evolutionary and cognitive perspective. Humor, they propose, evolved out of a computational problem that arose when our long-ago ancestors were furnished with open-ended thinking. Mother Nature&#x2015;aka natural selection&#x2015;cannot just order the brain to find and fix all our time-pressured misleaps and near-misses. She has to bribe the brain with pleasure. So we find them funny. This wired-in source of pleasure has been tickled relentlessly by humorists over the centuries, and we have become addicted to the endogenous mind candy that is humor.</p></p><p>Matthew M.

Adams, Jr., is Associate Professor of Psychology researching emotion and social perception at Penn State University.<p>Ever since Plato (who thought we laugh at vice), thinkers as serious as Kant and Freud have put forth theories of our giggles and guffaws. Hurley, Dennett, and Adams go at the problem with the ingenuity of first-rate scientists and the timing of first-rate comics. Not only do they have the riches of evolutionary psychology from which to draw, but they're even funnier than Hegel.</p>&#x2015;<b>Rebecca Newberger Goldstein</b>, author of <i>36 Arguments for the Existence of God: A Work of Fiction</i><br><br><p>The deft use of humor can win a mate, persuade an audience, or make a tyrant quake in his jackboots. Yet no one really understands why the human brain should respond so forcefully to that cocktail of anomaly, indignity, and rhythmic vocalization we call a joke. Hurley, Dennett, and Adams offer a sophisticated analysis of this important phenomenon using high standards of evolutionary explanation&#x2015;and no, it is not a turgid academic disquisition, but written with clarity, good cheer, and, of course, wit.</p>&#x2015;<b>Steven Pinker</b>, author of <i>How The Mind Works</i><br><br><p>Hurley and his crew cross the road to not just explain a joke, but explain all jokes. Before this book the only comedy that had been peer reviewed and replicated in double-blind experiments was the theory that there's nothing funnier than a smoking monkey.

In this highly original analysis, Hurley, Dennett, and Adams try to locate the holy grail, the essence of a joke, by using a variety of tools (from computer science, cognitive science, linguistics, philosophy, and even evolutionary psychology) to dissect why we laugh. This powerful team of authors goes a long way to explain why and when we laugh, and in doing so uncover insights about how the mind works. But like the proverbial millipede who, trying to analyze how he lifts each of his legs in the precise sequence, starts tripping over, readers should beware that getting inside a joke risks dehumorizing it!</p>&#x2015;<b>Simon Baron-Cohen</b>, Professor of Developmental Psychopathology and Director, Autism Research Centre, Cambridge University</p><h2>JOSEF ALBERS POEMS DRAWINGS /ANGLAIS</h2><p>In <i>Poems and Drawings</i>, first published in 1958, Josef Albers attempted to penetrate the meaning of art and life by the simplest, most disciplined means.

These qualitative features--uniqueness, existence, elegance of composition, and convergence modes--are substantiated by physical reasoning, rather than rigorous arguments. Geared toward applied mathematicians, physicists, engineers, and others seeking explicit solutions,&nbsp;the book&nbsp;offers heuristic justifications for each construction.<br>The first three chapters review the necessary tools for understanding the separation of variables technique: basics of ordinary differential equations, Frobenius-series construction and properties of Bessel functions, and Fourier analysis. Subsequent chapters explore the exposition of the algorithmic nature of the separation of variables process, based on a sequence of steps that infallibly leads to the solution expansion, regardless of the nature of the boundary conditions.</p><p>Offering a welcome balance between rigor and ease of comprehension, this book presents full coverage of the analytic (and accurate) method for solving PDEs -- in a manner that is both decipherable to engineers and physically insightful for mathematicians. By exploring the eigenfunction expansion method based on physical principles instead of abstract analyses, it makes the analytic approach understandable, visualizable, and straightforward to implement. Contains tabulations and derivations of all known eigenfunction expansions. Offers demystifying coverage of the separation of variables technique and presents a novel approach to FFT and its utilization. Presents a fast, automatic algorithmic procedure for solving wave, heat, and Laplace equation in rectangular, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates. Discusses Sturm-Liouville Theory; Green&#39;s functions and transform methods; and perturbation methods, small wave analysis, and dispersion laws. Motivates every technique presented --without exception -- by a heuristic discussion demonstrating the plausibility or inevitability of the procedure, and includes an abundance of figures and worked-out examples.

Even Bulgakov, who regarded Saltykov-Schhedrin as his teacher, who is the most satirical writer after Saltykov, and whose main works were unpublished until ten years ago, has been written about by representatives of many different critical sects. That Saltykov&#x2019;s works have not had this kind of appeal is somewhat puzzling...Even a Freudian novice could work Oedipal themes out of the autobiographical elements in The Golovlyov Family, and the Tartu University school could draw complex diagrams to show how The Golovyov Family is that most wonderful of all things, a "unified whole." It is time that Saltykov stopped being the exclusive property of critics whose primary concerns are sociological or historical. As the reader of The Golovlyov Family will see&#x2014;with considerable pleasure&#x2014;Saltykov&#x2019;s prose has much more to offer than not."</p></p><p>Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin (1826-1889) was born in Moscow in 1826, his first stories, deemed "subversive," were published in 1847, after which he was sentenced to exile for seven years.

But learning the language of science is a major part of science education: every science lesson is a language lesson, and language is a major barrier to most school students in learning science. This accessible book explores the main difficulties in the language of science and examines practical ways to aid students in retaining, understanding, reading, speaking and writing scientific language.<p> Jerry Wellington and Jonathan Osborne draw together and synthesize current good practice, thinking and research in this field. They use many practical examples, illustrations and tried-and-tested materials to exemplify principles and to provide guidelines in developing language and literacy in the learning of science. They also consider the impact that the growing use of information and communications technology has had, and will have, on writing, reading and information handling in science lessons.</p><p> The authors argue that paying more attention to language in science classrooms is one of the most important acts in improving the quality of science education. This is a significant and very readable book for all student and practising secondary school science teachers, for science advisers and school mentors.</p></p><p>Professor Jerry Wellington taught science in Tower Hamlets, London before moving to the University of Sheffield where he has extensive experience of teaching on PGCE courses, MEd and EdD work, INSET for teachers and mentor training programmes.

The Reformation shattered that unity, and the consequences are still with us today. In <em>All Things Made New</em>, Diarmaid MacCulloch, author of the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em>Christianity: The First Three Thousand Years, </em>examines not only the Reformation's impact across Europe, but also the Catholic Counter-Reformation and the special evolution of religion in England, revealing how one of the most turbulent, bloody, and transformational events in Western history has shaped modern society.<br><br>The Reformation may have launched a social revolution, MacCulloch argues, but it was not caused by social and economic forces, or even by a secular idea like nationalism; it sprang from a big idea about death, salvation, and the afterlife. This idea - that salvation was entirely in God's hands and there was nothing humans could do to alter his decision - ended the Catholic Church's monopoly in Europe and altered the trajectory of the entire future of the West.<br><br>By turns passionate, funny, meditative, and subversive, <em>All Things Made New</em> takes readers onto fascinating new ground, exploring the original conflicts of the Reformation and cutting through prejudices that continue to distort popular conceptions of a religious divide still with us after five centuries. This monumental work, from one of the most distinguished scholars of Christianity writing today, explores the ways in which historians have told the tale of the Reformation, why their interpretations have changed so dramatically over time, and ultimately, how the contested legacy of this revolution continues to impact the world today.<br></p><p><br><strong>Diarmaid MacCulloch</strong> is Professor of the History of the Church at Oxford University.

MacCulloch is an eminent professor of history at the University of Oxford, and not only brings a lifetime's learning to bear on his subject, but writes with vigour, empathy and wit. ... MacCulloch's book ... is not narrowly about religion, but broadly about identity and memory, about the importance of myths and why historians need to challenge them."--Malcolm Gaskill, <em>Financial Times</em> <br><p></p><br>"This excellent expos� of the English Reformation sheds light on how the period forged the practices of Western Christianity, both Protestant and Roman Catholic."--<em>Library Journal</em> <br><p></p><br>"Combining magisterial erudition with an accessible style, [MacCulloch] serves as a deft restorer of historical tableaux, stripping away the partisan varnishes that have altered our picture of these sixteenth and seventeenth-century movements... [his] essays on the Reformation and its legacy dazzle with flashes of fresh insight... [a] stunning feat of scholarship."--<em>Commonweal</em> <br><p></p><br>"MacCulloch ably conveys a sense of the ideological excitement of the era, when the majority of Western Europeans were jolted by the challenges of Martin Luther in terms of how people had considered death, salvation, and the afterlife... The author's treatment of the Tudors is masterly... Experts and lay readers alike can pick and choose elements from MacCulloch's vast store of knowledge."--<em>Kirkus</em> <br><p></p><br>"An intriguing set of essays...[with] fascinating tidbits about theology and church history in a format well suited to those who enjoy browsing a volume and tasting what they will."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em> <br><p></p><br>"An energetic, eccentric, and enjoyable meander through loosely connected themes of the English Reformation... MacCulloch's writing is characterized throughout by a skillful blend of expressive, accessible, and witty prose. He gives life to times much different than our own. At its best, the text is nothing short of captivating."--<em>U.S. Catholic</em> <br><p></p><br>"Like all enormous historical subjects, the Reformation is prone to myth-making among those who study it, and the only antidote is the sort of devil-in-the-details approach MacCulloch adopts... [He] is convincing about the place of ideas in the Reformation, one of the foundational blocks in Western thought."--<em>Maclean's</em> <br><p></p><br>"A remarkably coherent and consistently stimulating collection. Because MacCulloch writes so well, what would be an indulgence for many becomes a powerfully thoughtful reflection on both the foundations of the Protestant tradition and the very purpose of academic scholarship... This is a hugely readable book, sustained throughout by Diarmaid MacCulloch's marvelous instinct for the quirky and the original... Reading <em>All Things Made New</em> brings home an essential truth: that one can be funny, playful, and mildly seditious-and still be learned and authoritative. It is a lesson that academics need constantly to relearn."--<em>Weekly Standard</em> <br><p></p><br>"Overall, this is a delightful and enlightening book, and is not designed merely for those interested in the Anglican Church. As the author states in the preface, the work is not aimed just at Anglicans, and he does not see himself as an Anglican historian, but he is an historian who is an Anglican... The work belongs in all academic libraries which have holdings on the varied aspects of Reformation history, and especially upper-level college, university, and <br>seminary libraries. Much of the work can be readily enjoyed by educated, interested laypersons as well...Highly recommended."--<em>Catholic Library World</em><p></p><br>"<em>All Things Made New</em> is a serious book on a serious subject. It is written with elegance and sometimes donnish wit, but it is very far from being a book for specialists. As the author says, he aims to 'reflect on scholarship and interpret it for a wider audience', and he wears his learning pretty lightly."--<em>The Times</em> (UK) <br><p></p><br>"Dazzling... prodigiously learned... MacCulloch has a gift for explaining complicated things simply."--<em>Catholic Herald</em> (UK) <br><p></p><br>"MacCulloch is one of very best public historians: a charismatic telly don who has served his time in the academic trenches and is, as this collection triumphantly confirms, able to write authoritatively and engagingly on a remarkably diverse range of topics in the history of Christian culture and thought."--Peter Marshall, <em>Literary Review</em> (UK) <br><p></p><br>"[<em>All Things Made New</em>] exhibits MacCulloch's skills profusely.

Too often this hazardous material&#x2015;inked to high rates of illness and death and widespread ecosystem damage&#x2015;is exported to poor communities of color around the world. In <i>Resisting Global Toxics</i>, David Naguib Pellow examines this practice and charts the emergence of transnational environmental justice movements to challenge and reverse it. Pellow argues that waste dumping across national boundaries from rich to poor communities is a form of transnational environmental inequality that reflects North/South divisions in a globalized world, and that it must be theorized in the context of race, class, nation, and environment. Building on environmental justice studies, environmental sociology, social movement theory, and race theory, and drawing on his own research, interviews, and participant observations, Pellow investigates the phenomenon of global environmental inequality and considers the work of activists, organizations, and networks resisting it. He traces the transnational waste trade from its beginnings in the 1980s to the present day, examining global garbage dumping, the toxic pesticides that are the legacy of the Green Revolution in agriculture, and today's scourge of dumping and remanufacturing high tech and electronics products. The rise of the transnational environmental movements described in <i>Resisting Global Toxics</i> charts a pragmatic path toward environmental justice, human rights, and sustainability.</p></p><p>David Naguib Pellow is Don A. Martindale Endowed Chair in Sociology at the University of Minnesota. Among his books are the award-winning <i>Garbage Wars: The Struggle for Environmental Justice in Chicago</i> (MIT Press, 2002) and <i>Power, Justice, and the Environment: A Critical Appraisal of the Environmental Justice Movement</i> (coedited with Robert Brulle; MIT Press, 2005.)" "Resisting Global Toxics" provides a path breaking synthesis of the intersection of health, environment, and justice impacts of industrialization in the era of globalization. The book provides a rich blend of theoretical and activist perspectives and highlights the role of NGOs that are working to fill in the gaps in the absence of effective global governance. By drawing on his research and participation with grass roots groups, David Pellow is able to document a compelling and grounded form of global citizenship through the prism of race and class consciousness. He shows how local and transnational groups around the world are strategically addressing the full life-cycle impacts of globalization -- from hazardous production through hazardous waste disposal. As he says, 'Transnational environmental justice offenses require transnational responses.' This book provides authentic and compelling examples of such responses that are making real impacts." --Ted Smith, founder and Senior Strategist, Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition; Coordinator of International Campaign for Responsible Technology<br><br>" David Pellow has written a book that brings together a sophisticated understanding of the global economic system and the evolving transnational environmental justice movement.

While linking the global South and North, and drawing from a deep well of activist, academic, legal, and regulatory literatures, Pellow interrogates the unequal and deeply racialized relations embedded in the trading and dumping of hazardous wastes in poor communities and communities of color. Through critical advocacy research, he also charts the increasing sophistication of the resistance, namely the emerging transnational environmental justice movement networks, who are using a rights-based discourse to mobilize across national borders, and along racial, cultural, and class lines." --Julian Agyeman, Department of Urban and Environmental Policy and Planning, Tufts University<br><br>&amp; quot; David Pellow has written a book that brings together a sophisticated understanding of the global economic system and the evolving transnational environmental justice movement.

By drawing on his research and participation with grass roots groups, David Pellow is able to document a compelling and grounded form of global citizenship through the prism of race and class consciousness. He shows how local and transnational groups around the world are strategically addressing the full life-cycle impacts of globalization -- from hazardous production through hazardous waste disposal.

(What&#39;s So Cool About Geology)</h2><p>Every product we use, every new invention we create, every single thing we surround ourselves with comes from this Earth, with one exception&#x2015;meteorites. These exotic rocks have experienced journeys of cosmic proportions by the time we lay eyes on them. In the bitter cold temperatures of space, powerful collisions between asteroids scatter rocky debris in all directions, and some of it ends up on Earth. Authors Richard and Dorothy Norton explain where these mysterious rocks come from, what they&#x2019;re made of, and what happens when asteroids strike Earth. Explore how radiant fireballs are cataclysmically related to impact craters, discover helpful hints that guide readers on the dos and don&#x2019;ts of meteorite hunting, and learn how to properly distinguish meteorites from &#x201c;meteorwrongs&#x201d; with examples that are truly out of this world.

The text reflects BonJour&#39;s conviction that the place to start any discussion of the theories of knowledge is with the classical problems, beginning with and centered around Descartes. Only after the groundwork for understanding epistemology is laid does BonJour move on to the more contemporary revolutions against the classical approach. Epistemology: Classic Problems and Contemporary Responses is a versatile text that can be used in introductory-level epistemology courses or, supplemented by appropriate readings, an upper-level epistemology class offered in many philosophy departments. It is not, however, a simple reader of the different theories of knowledge. Epistemology prods students to think independently about the various epistemological approaches presented in the text, and form their own conclusions, thus becoming active participants in the ongoing debate.</p><p>Laurence BonJour is professor of philosophy at the University of Washington.<i>Epistemology</i> is destined to become a classic. BonJour gives the reader a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental issues of epistemology. In the great tradition of philosophers like Russell and Ayer, BonJour has written a book that will be accessible and compelling to readers of all backgrounds. (Fumerton, Richard)<br><br>Laurence BonJour's fine new textbook covers a wide range of topics in contemporary epistemology, using key historical sources to set up the issues. BonJour presents the issues and arguments in an accessible and non-technical manner without sacrificing necessary details. This is an excellent introduction to epistemology. (Feldman, Richard)<br><br>Laurence BonJour's <i>Epistemology</i> is a rich and thorough, historically informed introduction to the traditional core questions of epistemology. Authored by a foremost exponent of the traditional core answers, at the top of his form, it is a lucid defense of internalist, Cartesian foundationalism, one that should be accessible to undergraduates with no background in philosophy.

The existence of that forest, and the effort either to use or subdue it, have been constant themes in American history, literature, economics, and geography up to the meaning of the forest in American history and culture, he describes and analyzes the clearing and use of the forest from pre-European times to the present, and he traces the subsequent regrowth of the forest since the middle of the twentieth century. Dr Williams begins by exploring the role of the forest in American culture: the symbols, themes, and concepts - for example, pioneer woodsman, lumberjack, wilderness - generated by contact with the vast land of trees. He considers the Indian use of the forest, describing the ways in which native tribes altered it, primarily through fire, to promote a subsistence economy. Early European settlers, he shows, extracted many products from the forest, and also began the extensive clearance of trees that would continue for almost three hundred years. Succeeding chapters, organized by topic and region, cover agricultural and industrial effects upon and uses of the forest. Dr Williams explores the rise (and often fall) of industries based upon forest products: naval stores, timber for building, charcoal and the iron industry, the railroads. Attention is devoted to the forests of the Middle West, the South, and the Pacific Northwest. By the late nineteenth century Americans began to realize that the forest was not boundless and moved to preserve those portions, still extensive, that remained. In the wake of the movement for preservation, Dr Williams describes how the forest began to regrow, especially after 1950, in areas where it had originally been vigorous and healthy, a development that continues today.</p><p>Dr Williams begins by exploring the role of the forest in American culture: the symbols, themes, and concepts - for example, pioneer woodsman, lumberjack, wilderness - generated by contact with the vast land of trees.

In the same way, says Tara Bennett-Goleman, we all have the natural ability to turn our moments of confusion or emotional pain into insightful clarity.<br><br> <i>Emotional Alchemy</i> maps the mind and shows how, according to recent advances in cognitive therapy, most of what troubles us falls into ten basic emotional patterns, including fear of abandonment, social exclusion (the feeling that we don&#x2019;t belong), and vulnerability (the feeling that some catastrophe will occur). This remarkable book also teaches us how we can free ourselves of such patterns and replace them with empathy for ourselves and others through the simple practice of mindfulness, an awareness that lets us see things as they truly are without distortion or judgment. Emotional Alchemy provides an insightful explanation of how mindfulness can change not only our lives, but the very structure of our brains, giving us the freedom to be more creative and alive. <br><br> Here is a beautifully rendered work full of Buddhist wisdom and stories of how people have used mindfulness to conquer their self-defeating habits. The result is a whole new way of approaching our relationships, work, and internal lives.</p><p>According to ancient legends, alchemists use a magical philosopher's stone to transmute lead into gold. In <i>Emotional Alchemy</i>, Tara Bennett-Goleman shows readers how they can use this alchemist metaphor to transform emotional confusion (lead) into insightful clarity (gold). And what does the magic stone represent? "Mindfulness," a lifelong practice that can bring readers more joy and contentment than the gold, according to Bennett-Goleman. "Mindfulness means seeing things as they are without trying to change them," she writes. "The point is to dissolve our reactions to disturbing emotions, being careful not to reject the emotion itself."<p> Those who have never entered this practice will find a concise and articulate teacher in Bennett-Goleman, who leads national workshops with her husband, author Daniel Goleman (<i>Emotional Intelligence</i>). What make this book such an exciting breakthrough is Bennett-Goleman's ability to apply Buddhist mindfulness to Western psychology. She shows how emotional alchemy can be used to address typical habits, such as mistrust, fear of rejection, feeling unlovable. Readers will also find fascinating scientific facts on how emotional alchemy affects brain chemistry and even cancer survival. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>"A wonderfully clear, compassionate, and insightful guide to freeing ourselves from difficult emotions."<br>-- Sharon Salzberg, author of Lovingkindness<br><br>"A wonderfully wise book, one that is down to earth and immensely practical. I know I will be using it as a resource in my own life for a long time."<br>-- Susan Griffin, author of A Chorus of Stones and What Her Body Thought<br><br>"May this very important and enticing book find its way into the hearts of readers near and far so that it can perform its mysterious and healing alchemy for the benefit of all. Tara Bennett-Goleman has done a great service in describing in such inspiring and precise ways how meditative practices can liberate us from the patterns of emotional reactions that, unexamined, lead invariably to suffering and harm."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>-- Jon Kabat-Zinn, author of Wherever You Go There You Are and professor of medicine at University of Massachusetts Medical School<br><br>"A rare accomplishment, bringing the synthesis of Western psychology and Buddhist mindfulness practice to an entirely new level. Much more than theory, it is a wise and pragmatic guide to emotional freedom. Tara Bennett-Goleman weaves together with consummate skill the wisdom teachings of the East, the latest understandings of cognitive therapy and neuroscience, and the innumerable personal stories that bring all of it to life."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>-- Joseph Goldstein, author of Insight Meditation<br><br>"Gliding effortlessly from personal reminiscence to the latest in neuroscience, from meditation instruction to the intricacies of cognitive therapy, Tara Bennett-Goleman invites us to be part of her journey. In showing us how to use our minds to heal our emotions, she heals our minds with her heart."<br>-- Mark Epstein, M.D., author of Thoughts Without a Thinker and Going to Pieces Without Falling Apart<br><br>"A very accessible and practical guide to transforming emotions. If you wish to know how your emotional habits can be changed, this book is for you."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>-- Richard J. Davidson, director, Wisconsin Center for Affective Science and W. M.

Conventionally regarded as a history play, much of it is in fact conspicuously invented fiction, and Kastan argues that the non-historical, comic plot does not simply parody the historical action but by its existence raises questions about the very nature of history. The full and engaging introduction devotes extensive discussion to the play&#39;s language, indicating how its insistent economic vocabulary provides texture for the social concerns of the play and focuses attention on the central relationship between value and political authority.</p><p><p>David Scott Kastan is a professor of English at Yale University.</p></p><h2>Why Translation Matters (Why X Matters Series)</h2><p><p><i>Why Translation Matters</i> argues for the cultural importance of translation and for a more encompassing and nuanced appreciation of the translator&#x2019;s role. As the acclaimed translator Edith Grossman writes in her introduction, &#x201c;My intention is to stimulate a new consideration of an area of literature that is too often ignored, misunderstood, or misrepresented.&#x201d;</p><p>For Grossman, translation has a transcendent importance: &#x201c;Translation not only plays its important traditional role as the means that allows us access to literature originally written in one of the countless languages we cannot read, but it also represents a concrete literary presence with the crucial capacity to ease and make more meaningful our relationships to those with whom we may not have had a connection before. Translation always helps us to know, to see from a different angle, to attribute new value to what once may have been unfamiliar. As nations and as individuals, we have a critical need for that kind of understanding and insight. The alternative is unthinkable.&#x201d;</p><p>Throughout the four chapters of this bracing volume, Grossman&#x2019;s belief in the crucial significance of the translator&#x2019;s work, as well as her rare ability to explain the intellectual sphere that she inhabits as interpreter of the original text, inspires and provokes the reader to engage with translation in an entirely new way.</p></p><p><b>Edith Grossman</b> is the acclaimed translator of Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez, Mario Vargas Llosa, Carlos Fuentes, Mayra Montero, and many other distinguished Spanish-language writers. Her translation of <i>Don Quixote</i> is widely considered a masterpiece.

She is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. She lives in New York.&#x201c;Edith Grossman, the Glenn Gould of translators, has written a superb book on the art of the literary translation.&nbsp; Even Walter Benjamin is surpassed by her insights into her task, which she rightly sees as imaginatively independent.&nbsp;This should become a classic text.&#x201d;&#x2014;Harold Bloom (Harold Bloom)<br><br> &#x201c;Grossman and others like her continue to offer us enlightenment. . . .[The subject] is passionately explored and patiently explained.&#x201d;--Richard Howard, <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br> (Richard Howard <i>New York Times Book Review</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Required reading for publishers the world over. . . .

Transaction cost economics, which studies the governance of contractual relations, is the branch of the New Institutional Economics with which Oliver Williamson is especially associated.<br><br>Transaction cost economics takes issue with one of the fundamental building blocks in microeconomics: the theory of the firm. Whereas orthodox economics describes the firm in technological terms, as a production function, transaction cost economics describes the firm in organizational terms, as a governance structure. Alternative feasible forms of organization--firms, markets, hybrids, bureaus--are examined comparatively. The analytical action resides in the details of transactions and the mechanisms of governance.<br><br>Transaction cost economics has had a pervasive influence on current economic thought about how and why institutions function as they do, and it has become a practical framework for research in organizations by representatives of a variety of disciplines. Through a transaction cost analysis, <em>The</em> <em>Mechanisms of Governance</em> shows how and why simple contracts give way to complex contracts and internal organization as the hazards of contracting build up. That complicates the study of economic organization, but a richer and more relevant theory of organization is the result. Many testable implications and lessons for public policy accrue to this framework. Applications of both kinds are numerous and growing.<br><br>Written by one of the leading economic theorists of our time, <em>The Mechanisms of Governance</em> is sure to be an important work for years to come. It will be of interest to scholars and students of economics, organization, management, and law.<br></p><p><br>Oliver E. Williamson is the Edgar F.

Nearly 50 generous selections include seminal contributions from Howard, Le Corbusier, Lynch, and Jacobs to more recent writings by Waldheim, Koolhaas, and Sorkin. Following the widespread success of the first edition of <i>The Urban Design Reader</i>, this updated edition continues to provide the most important historical material of the urban design field, but also introduces new topics and selections that address the myriad challenges facing designers today.</p> <p>The six part structure of the second edition guides the reader through the history, theory and practice of urban design. The reader is initially introduced to those classic writings that provide the historical precedents for city-making into the twentieth century. Part Two introduces the voices and ideas that were instrumental in establishing the foundations of the urban design field from the late 1950s up to the mid-1990s. These authors present a critical reading of the design professions and offer an alternative urban design agenda focused on vital and lively places. The authors in Part Three provide a range of urban design rationales and strategies for reinforcing local physical identity and the creation of memorable places. These selections are largely describing the outcomes of mid-century urban design and voicing concerns over the placeless quality of contemporary urbanism. The fourth part of the Reader explores key issues in urban design and development. Ideas about sprawl, density, community health, public space and everyday life are the primary focus here. Several new selections in this part of the book also highlight important international development trends in the Middle East and China. Part Five presents environmental challenges faced by the built environment professions today, including recent material on landscape urbanism, sustainability, and urban resiliency. The final part examines professional practice and current debates in the field: where urban designers work, what they do, their roles, their fields of knowledge and their educational development. The section concludes with several position pieces and debates on the future of urban design practice.</p> <p>This book provides an essential resource for students and practitioners of urban design, drawing together important but widely dispersed writings. Part and section introductions are provided to assist readers in understanding the context of the material, summary messages, impacts of the writing, and how they fit into the larger picture of the urban design field.</p></p><p><p><strong>Michael Larice </strong>is Associate Professor of Urban Design and City Planning at the University of Utah &#x2013; College of Architecture and Planning.

Citizen Subject is the summation of �tienne Balibar&#x2019;s career-long project to think the necessary and necessarily antagonistic relation between the categories of citizen and subject. In this magnum opus, the question of modernity is framed anew with special attention to the self-enunciation of the subject (in Descartes, Locke, Rousseau, and Derrida), the constitution of the community as &#x201c;we&#x201d; (in Hegel, Marx, and Tolstoy), and the aporia of the judgment of self and others (in Foucualt, Freud, Kelsen, and Blanchot).</p><p>After the &#x201c;humanist controversy&#x201d; that preoccupied twentieth-century philosophy, Citizen Subject proposes foundations for philosophical anthropology today, in terms of two contrary movements: the becoming-citizen of the subject and the becoming-subject of the citizen. The citizen-subject who is constituted in the claim to a &#x201c;right to have rights&#x201d; (Arendt) cannot exist without an underside that contests and defies it. He&#x2015;or she, because Balibar is concerned throughout this volume with questions of sexual difference&#x2015;figures not only the social relation but also the discontent or the uneasiness at the heart of this relation. The human can be instituted only if it betrays itself by upholding &#x201c;anthropological differences&#x201d; that impose normality and identity as conditions of belonging to the community.</p><p>The violence of &#x201c;civil&#x201d; bourgeois universality, Balibar argues, is greater (and less legitimate, therefore less stable) than that of theological or cosmological universality. Right is thus founded on insubordination, and emancipation derives its force from otherness.</p><p>Ultimately, Citizen Subject offers a revolutionary rewriting of the dialectic of universality and differences in the bourgeois epoch, revealing in the relationship between the common and the universal a political gap at the heart of the universal itself.</p></p><p><b>�tienne Balibar</b> is Professor Emeritus of Moral and Political Philosophy at Universit� de Paris X&#x2013;Nanterre; Distinguished Professor of Humanities at the University of California, Irvine; and Visiting Professor of French at Columbia University.

Under the heading of 'universality,' a concept that Balibar has almost single-handedly salvaged, Citizen Subject tries to rethink political belonging in our time, so as to redeem a humanism capable of contesting itself from the inside and available to serve the struggles of our day. Balibar rewrites a central tradition of Western philosophy from Descartes through Locke, Rousseau, Hegel, Marx, and Nietzsche, and from Wolstonecraft through Fanon, showing in case after brilliant case that the very writers most invoked as origins (or critics) of the subject had in fact been engaged in a common enterprise of thinking a social, nontranscendent self, the democratic citizen under the contradictory conditions of modernity. The result is one of the strongest, most ambitious, and most pertinent rewritings of the history of philosophy that readers are likely to encounter in their lifetimes.

Environmental justice advocates argue that these communities are on the front lines of environmental and health risks. In <i>Noxious New York,</i> Julie Sze analyzes the culture, politics, and history of environmental justice activism in New York City within the larger context of privatization, deregulation, and globalization. She tracks urban planning and environmental health activism in four gritty New York neighborhoods: Brooklyn's Sunset Park and Williamsburg sections, West Harlem, and the South Bronx. In these communities, activism flourished in the 1980s and 1990s in response to economic decay and a concentration of noxious incinerators, solid waste transfer stations, and power plants. Sze describes the emergence of local campaigns organized around issues of asthma, garbage, and energy systems, and how, in each neighborhood, activists framed their arguments in the vocabulary of environmental justice. Sze shows that the linkage of planning and public health in New York City goes back to the nineteenth century's sanitation movement, and she looks at the city's history of garbage, sewage, and sludge management. She analyzes the influence of race, family, and gender politics on asthma activism and examines community activists' responses to garbage privatization and energy deregulation. Finally, she looks at how activist groups have begun to shift from fighting particular siting and land use decisions to engaging in a larger process of community planning and community-based research projects. Drawing extensively on fieldwork and interviews with community members and activists, Sze illuminates the complex mix of local and global issues that fuels environmental justice activism.</p></p><p>Julie Sze is Professor and the Founding Chair of American Studies at the University of California, Davis.

It also addresses the relevance of the law of inter-state force to targeted killings, and the interrelation of the various normative frameworks which may simultaneously apply to operations involving the intentional use of lethal force. Through a comprehensive analysis of treaties, custom, and general principles of law in light of jurisprudence, doctrine, and travaux preparatoires the author demonstrates that contemporary international law provides two distinct normative paradigms which govern the use of lethal force in law enforcement and in the conduct of hostilities. Based on the resulting normative paradigms, the author shows in what circumstances targeted killings may be considered as internationally lawful. The practical relevance of the various conditions and modalities is illustrated by reference to concrete examples of targeted killing from recent State practice. In essence the book argues that any targeted killing not directed against a legitimate military target remains subject to the law enforcement paradigm, which imposes extensive restraints on the practice. Even under the paradigm of hostilities, no person can be lawfully liquidated without further considerations. As a form of individualized or surgical warfare, the method of targeted killing requires a &#39;microscopic&#39; interpretation of the law regulating the conduct of hostilities which leads to nuanced results. The author concludes by highlighting and comparing the main areas of concern arising with regard to State-sponsored targeted killing under each normative paradigm and by placing the results of the analysis in the wider context of the rule of law.</p><p><br><strong>Nils Melzer </strong>is a Legal Adviser for the International Committee of the Red Cross.<br><br>"The book is a well written, clearly structured, thoughtful and measured account of issues such as current state practice, judicial consideration and relevant international law...In essence<em> Targeted Killing in International Law</em>is a book about balance and the desire for careful consideration before the application of policies involving the destruction of lives. Melzer deals with each of the legal issues involved in targeted killing with clarity and precision...Melzer's detailed examination is a large step forward in the development of a better understanding of the issues and particular pressure points that daily engage advisers, courts, international lawyers and politicians when trying to determine when the state is in the position to take lives." <br>--The Australian Yearbook of International Law, Volume 27<p></p><br>"Melzer's book makes a significant contribution to our understanding of hot targeted killing is regulated by international law. His sensible definition of the problem, his principled division of the analysis into law enforcement and hostilities paradigms, his provocative analysis of military necessity, and his coverage of often overlooked aspects, such as booby-traps, will no doubt influence future work on this issue." <br>--William Abresch, European Journal of International Law, 2009<p></p><br>"Mr Melzer's monograph is a very articulated and expert account of the legal framework governing targeted killings in both peacetime and during an armed conflict. It is recommended for those who want to expand their knowledge of the topic." <br>--Vincent Roobaert, Assistant Legal Adviser, NC3A<p></p><br>"Targeted Killing in International Law is a piece of solid scholarship which can only be recommended to scholars, practitioners, and students alike...it is a very methodically researched treatise which will become a useful work of reference on the topic. It is definitely a step towards finally settling the legal problems surrounding the question of targeted killing and will hopefully help to bring an end to the 'shadowy realm of half-legality and non-accountability.'" <br>--Tamas Hoffmann, Corvinus University, Budapest, Leiden Journal of International Law, vol 22<p></p><br></p><h2>A Second, a Minute, a Week with Days in It: A Book about Time (Math Is CATegorical �)</h2><p><p>The zany CATegorical cats introduce the measurement of time, from seconds, minutes, and hours up to decades.

And, appropriately, when he was invited to deliver the prestigious Charles Eliot Norton Lectures at Harvard, he chose Romanesque architectural sculpture as his topic. These lectures, acclaimed for the verve and freshness with which Schapiro delivered them, languished unpublished for decades. But Linda Seidel, who knew Schapiro well and attended the 1967 lectures, has now expertly transcribed and edited them, presenting them for the first time to an audience beyond the halls of Harvard.&nbsp;<br><br>In editing the lectures, Seidel closely followed the recordings of the originals. Sentences are rendered as Schapiro spoke them, affording readers a unique opportunity to experience the legendary teacher as he rarely appears in print: forming his thoughts spontaneously, interrupting himself to develop related ideas, and responding to the audience&#x2019;s interests by introducing humorous asides. Nonetheless, these lectures are carefully constructed, demonstrating Schapiro&#x2019;s commitment to the originality and value of artistic production and affirming his lifelong belief in artists&#x2019; engagement with their cultures. Amply illustrated with many key works and augmented with Seidel&#x2019;s indispensable introduction, this long-awaited volume will delight students and scholars of art history, as well as anyone interested in seeing a new side of a profoundly influential mind. <br><br></p></p><p><p><b>Meyer Schapiro</b> was University Professor at Columbia University.

(Vibeke Olsen <i>Sehepunkt</i>)<br><br>"The quality of the text is that of close looking and careful analysis. It is a revelation to read Schapiro on the <i>Eve</i> of Autun." (Svetlana Alpers <i>Key Reporter</i>)</p><h2>The Great Bridge</h2><p><b>This monumental book tells the enthralling story of one of the greatest accomplishments in our nation�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s history, the building of what was then the longest suspension bridge in the world. The Brooklyn Bridge rose out of the expansive era following the Civil War, when Americans believed all things were possible.</b> <p>So daring a concept as spanning the East River to join two great cities required vision and dedication of the kind that went into building Europe�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s great cathedrals. During fourteen years of construction, the odds against success seemed overwhelming. Thousands of people were put to work. Bodies were crushed and broken, lives lost, notorious political empires fell, and surges of public doubt constantly threatened the project. But the story of the building of the Brooklyn Bridge is not just the saga of an engineering miracle; it is a sweeping narrative of the social climate of the time, replete with heroes and rascals who helped either to construct or to exploit the great enterprise. </p><p><i>The Great Bridge </i>is also the story of a remarkable family, the Roeblings, who conceived and executed the audacious engineering plan at great personal cost. Without John Roebling�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s vision, his son Washington�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s skill and courage, and Washington�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s wife Emily�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s dedication, the bridge we know and cherish would never have been built. </p><p>Like the engineering marvel it describes, <i>The Great Bridge</i>, republished on the fortieth anniversary of its initial publication, has stood the test of time.</p></p><p>In the 19th century, the Brooklyn Bridge was viewed as the greatest engineering feat of mankind. The Roeblings--father and son--toiled for decades, fighting competitors, corrupt politicians, and the laws of nature to fabricate a bridge which, after 100 years, still provides one of the major avenues of access to one of the world&#39;s busiest cities--as compared to many bridges built at the same time which collapsed within decades or even years. It is refreshing to read such a magnificent story of real architecture and engineering in an era where these words refer to tiny bits and bytes that inspire awe only in their abstract consequences, and not in their tangible physical magnificence.David McCullough has twice received the Pulitzer Prize, for <i>Truman </i>and <i>John Adams,</i> and twice received the National Book Award, for <i>The Path Between the Seas</i> and <i>Mornings on Horseback</i>.

In this book a leading Africanist presents the first full-length anthropological account of the Swahili and offers an original analysis of their little-understood and unusual culture. &nbsp;Swahili towns, some urban with elegant stone buildings and others more rural with palm-leaf-matting houses, are spread along the thousand-mile East African coast. Because each local community is culturally different from its neighbors, previous historians and anthropologists have viewed the Swahili as a series of isolated and 'detribalized' groups. John Middleton argues, on the contrary, that beneath the cultural variation is a single structure, that of a well-defined and complex trading society that has shown little change through the ages. Drawing on his own field research and on earlier writings on the Swahili, Middleton describes this centuries-old mercantile culture&#x2015;its local and descent groupings, marriage patterns, religion, and values. He traces the history of their colonized past as subjects to Arabs, Portuguese, British, and others and shows that, although their economic and political role has continually been a subordinate one, their sense of their unique identity enables them to persist as an ongoing civilization.</p><p></p><h2>The Black Arrow: A Tale of the Two Roses (Signet Classics)</h2><p><b>From the beloved author of <i>Treasure Island</i> and <i>Kidnapped</i> . . .</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> England is in the throes of the War of the Roses.

At the center are Barb and Lily, two women at opposite ends of the beauty spectrum, but with the same problem: each fears she will never find a love that can overcome her looks. Barb, a stunningly beautiful costume designer, makes herself ugly in hopes of finding true love. Meanwhile, her friend Lily, a brilliantly talented but plain-looking musician, goes to fantastic lengths to attract the man who has rejected her&#x2015;with results that are as touching as they are transformative.</p><p>To complicate matters, Barb and Lily discover that they may have a murderer in their midst, that Barb&#x2019;s calm disposition is more dangerously provocative than her beauty ever was, and that Lily's musical talents are more powerful than anyone could have imagined. Part literary whodunit, part surrealist farce, <em>The Unfortunate Importance of Beauty</em> is a smart, modern-day fairy tale. With biting wit and offbeat charm, Amanda Filipacchi illuminates the labyrinthine relationship between beauty, desire, and identity, asking at every turn: what does it truly mean to allow oneself to be seen?</p></p><p>Amanda Filipacchi is the author of three previous novels, Nude Men, Vapor, and, most recently, Love Creeps.

But what is it? Landscape architects are involved, amongst other things, in the layout of business parks, the reclamation of derelict industrial sites, the restoration of historic city parks, and the design of major pieces of infrastructure such as motorways, dams, power stations, and flood defenses, as well as the planning of parks and gardens. Taking a historical perspective, Ian Thompson looks at both the roots of landscape architecture and the people that established it. <br><br>This <em>Very Short Introduction</em> explores some of the misconceptions about landscape architecture and considers the discipline's origins in landscape gardening. Thompson takes a look at a number of areas, including the influence of Modernism, the difference between landscape design and landscape planning, and the way that planning legislation has driven the growth of the discipline. He also explores contemporary environmentalism, the debate as to whether landscape architecture is an art or a science, landscape architecture in the community, post-industrial projects, and its relationship with ecological urbanism.<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong><br>Oxford's <strong>Very Short Introductions</strong> series offers concise and original introductions to a wide range of subjects--from Islam to Sociology, Politics to Classics, Literary Theory to History, and Archaeology to the Bible.

Critics have praised either Hamlet or King Lear as the greatest of these; Ernst Honigmann, in the most significant edition of the play for a generation, asks: why not Othello? The third of the mature tragedies, it contains, as Honigmann persuasively demonstrates, perhaps the best plot, two of Shakespeare�&#39;s most original characters, the most powerful scene in any of the plays and poetry second to none. Honigmann�&#39;s cogent and closely argued introduction outlines the reasons both for a reluctance to recognize the greatness of Othello and for the case against the play. This edition sheds new light on the text of the play as we have come to know it, and on our knowledge of its early history. Honigmann examines the major critical issues, the play in performance and the relationship between reading it and seeing it. He also explores topics such as its date, sources and the conundrum of �&#39;double time�&#39;. &#39;Honigmann&#39;s extensive knowledge illuminates this play at every turn, making this the best edition of Othello now available.&#39; Brian Vickers, Review of English Studies</p><p>William Shakespeare (1564-1616) was an English dramatist, poet, and actor, generally regarded as the greatest playwright of all time.</p><h2>Socially Savvy: An Assessment and Curriculum Guide for Young Children</h2><p>Socially Savvy helps educators and parents break down broad areas of social functioning into concrete skills.

For a chronological list of Russell's principal works see <i>The Basic Writings of Bertrand Russell</i> (Simon and Schuster).<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br><b>Why I Am Not a Christian</b><br><br><i>This lecture was delivered on March 6, 1927, at Battersea Town Hail under the auspices of the South London Branch of the National Secular Society.</i><br><br>As your Chairman has told you, the subject about which I am going to speak to you tonight is "Why I Am Not a Christian." Perhaps it would be as well, first of all, to try to make out what one means by the word <i>Christian.</i> It is used these days in a very loose sense by a great many people. Some people mean no more by it than a person who attempts to live a good life. In that sense I suppose there would be Christians in all sects and creeds; but I do not think that that is the proper sense of the word, if only because it would imply that all the people who are not Christians -- all the Buddhists, Confucians, Mohammedans, and so on -- are not trying to live a good life. I do not mean by a Christian any person who tries to live decently according to his lights. I think that you must have a certain amount of definite belief before you have a right to call yourself a Christian. The word does not have quite such a full-blooded meaning now as it had in the times of St. Augustine and St. Thomas Aquinas. In those days, if a man said that he was a Christian it was known what he meant. You accepted a whole collection of creeds which were set out with great precision, and every single syllable of those creeds you believed with the whole strength of your convictions.<br><br><i>What Is a Christian?</i><br><br>Nowadays it is not quite that. We have to be a little more vague in our meaning of Christianity. I think, however, that there are two different items which are quite essential to anybody calling himself a Christian. The first is one of a dogmatic nature -- namely, that you must believe in God and immortality. If you do not believe in those two things, I do not think that you can properly call yourself a Christian. Then, further than that, as the name implies, you must have some kind of belief about Christ. The Mohammedans, for instance, also believe in God and in immortality, and yet they would not call themselves Christians. I think you must have at the very lowest the belief that Christ was, if not divine, at least the best and wisest of men. If you are not going to believe that much about Christ, I do not think you have any right to call yourself a Christian. Of course, there is another sense, which you find in <i>Whitaker's Almanack</i> and in geography books, where the population of the world is said to be divided into Christians, Mohammedans, Buddhists, fetish worshipers, and so on; and in that sense we are all Christians. The geography books count us all in, but that is a purely geographical sense, which I suppose we can ignore. Therefore I take it that when I tell you why I am not a Christian I have to tell you two different things: first, why I do not believe in God and in immortality; and, secondly, why I do not think that Christ was the best and wisest of men, although I grant him a very high degree of moral goodness.<br><br>But for the successful efforts of unbelievers in the past, I could not take so elastic a definition of Christianity as that. As I said before, in olden days it had a much more full-blooded sense. For instance, it included the belief in hell. Belief in eternal hell-fire was an essential item of Christian belief until pretty recent times. In this country, as you know, it ceased to be an essential item because of a decision of the Privy Council, and from that decision the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Archbishop of York dissented; but in this country our religion is settled by Act of Parliament, and therefore the Privy Council was able to override their Graces and hell was no longer necessary to a Christian. Consequently I shall not insist that a Christian must believe in hell.<br><br><i>The Existence of God</i><br><br>To come to this question of the existence of God: it is a large and serious question, and if I were to attempt to deal with it in any adequate manner I should have to keep you here until Kingdom Come, so that you will have to excuse me if I deal with it in a somewhat summary fashion. You know, of course, that the Catholic Church has laid it down as a dogma that the existence of God can be proved by the unaided reason. That is a somewhat curious dogma, but it is one of their dogmas. They had to introduce it because at one time the freethinkers adopted the habit of saying that there were such and such arguments which mere reason might urge against the existence of God, but of course they knew as a matter of faith that God did exist. The arguments and the reasons were set out at great length, and the Catholic Church felt that they must stop it. Therefore they laid it down that the existence of God can be proved by the unaided reason and they had to set up what they considered were arguments to prove it. There are, of course, a number of them, but I shall take only a few.<br><br><i>The First-cause Argument</i><br><br>Perhaps the simplest and easiest to understand is the argument of the First Cause. (It is maintained that everything we see in this world has a cause, and as you go back in the chain of causes further and further you must come to a First Cause, and to that First Cause you give the name of God.) That argument, I suppose, does not carry very much weight nowadays, because, in the first place, cause is not quite what it used to be. The philosophers and the men of science have got going on cause, and it has not anything like the vitality it used to have; but, apart from that, you can see that the argument that there must be a First Cause is one that cannot have any validity. I may say that when I was a young man and was debating these questions very seriously in my mind, I for a long time accepted the argument of the First Cause, until one day, at the age of eighteen, I read John Stuart Mill's Autobiography, and I there found this sentence: "My father taught me that the question 'Who made me?' cannot be answered, since it immediately suggests the further question 'Who made God?'" That very simple sentence showed me, as I still think, the fallacy in the argument of the First Cause. If everything must have a cause, then God must have a cause. If there can be anything without a cause, it may just as well be the world as God, so that there cannot be any validity in that argument. It is exactly of the same nature as the Hindu's view, that the world rested upon an elephant and the elephant rested upon a tortoise; and when they said, "How about the tortoise?" the Indian said, "Suppose we change the subject." The argument is really no better than that. There is no reason why the world could not have come into being without a cause; nor, on the other hand, is there any reason why it should not have always existed. There is no reason to suppose that the world had a beginning at all. The idea that things must have a beginning is really due to the poverty of our imagination. Therefore, perhaps, I need not waste any more time upon the argument about the First Cause.<br><br><i>The Natural-law Argument</i><br><br>Then there is a very common argument from natural law. That was a favorite argument all through the eighteenth century, especially under the influence of Sir Isaac Newton and his cosmogony. People observed the planets going around the sun according to the law of gravitation, and they thought that God had given a behest to these planets to move in that particular fashion, and that was why they did so. That was, of course, a convenient and simple explanation that saved them the trouble of looking any further for explanations of the law of gravitation. Nowadays we explain the law of gravitation in a somewhat complicated fashion that Einstein has introduced. I do not propose to give you a lecture on the law of gravitation, as interpreted by Einstein, because that again would take some time; at any rate, you no longer have the sort of natural law that you had in the Newtonian system, where, for some reason that nobody could understand, nature behaved in a uniform fashion. We now find that a great many things we thought were natural laws are really human conventions. You know that even in the remotest depths of stellar space there are still three feet to a yard. That is, no doubt, a very remarkable fact, but you would hardly call it a law of nature. And a great many things that have been regarded as laws of nature are of that kind. On the other hand, where you can get down to any knowledge of what atoms actually do, you will find they are much less subject to law than people thought, and that the laws at which you arrive are statistical averages of just the sort that would emerge from chance. There is, as we all know, a law that if you throw dice you will get double sixes only about once in thirty-six times, and we do not regard that as evidence that the fall of the dice is regulated by design; on the contrary, if the double sixes came every time we should think that there was design. The laws of nature are of that sort as regards a great many of them. They are statistical averages such as would emerge from the laws of chance; and that makes this whole business of natural law much less impressive than k formerly was. Quite apart from that, which represents the momentary state of science that may change tomorrow, the whole idea that natural laws imply a lawgiver is due to a confusion between natural and human laws. Human laws are behests commanding you to behave a certain way, in which way you may choose to behave, or you may choose not to behave; but natural laws are a description of how things do in fact behave, and being a mere description of what they in fact do, you cannot argue that there must be somebody who told them to do that, because even supposing that there were, you are then faced with the question "Why did God issue just those natural laws and no others?" If you say that he did it simply from his own good pleasure, and without any reason, you then find that there is something which is not subject to law, and so your train of natural law is interrupted. If you say, as more orthodox theologians do, that in all the laws which God issues he had a reason for giving those laws rather than others -- the reason, of course, being to create the best universe, although you would never think it to look at it -- if there were a reason for the laws which God gave, then God himself was subject to law, and therefore you do not get any advantage by introducing God as an intermediary. You have really a law outside and anterior to the divine edicts, and God does not serve your purpose, because he is not the ultimate lawgiver. In short, this whole argument about natural law no longer has anything like the strength that it used to have. I am traveling on in time in my review of the arguments. The arguments that are used for the existence of God change their character as time goes on. They were at first hard intellectual arguments embodying certain quite definite fallacies. As we come to modern times they become less respectable intellectually and more and more affected by a kind of moralizing vagueness.<br><br><i>The Argument from Design</i><br><br>The next step in this process brings us to the argument from design. You all know the argument from design: everything in the world is made just so that we can manage to live in the world, and if the world was ever so little different, we could not manage to live in it. That is the argument from design. It sometimes takes a rather curious form; for instance, it is argued that rabbits have white tails in order to be easy to shoot. I do not know how rabbits would view that application. It is an easy argument to parody. You all know Voltaire's remark, that obviously the nose was designed to be such as to fit spectacles. That sort of parody has turned out to be not nearly so wide of the mark as it might have seemed in the eighteenth century, because since the time of Darwin we understand much better why living creatures are adapted to their environment. It is not that their environment was made to be suitable to them but that they grew to be suitable to it, and that is the basis of adaptation. There is no evidence of design about it.<br><br>When you come to look into this argument from design, it is a most astonishing thing that people can believe that this world, with all the things that are in it, with all its defects, should be the best that omnipotence and omniscience have been able to produce in millions of years. I really cannot believe it. Do you think that, if you were granted omnipotence and omniscience and millions of years in which to perfect your world, you could produce nothing better than the Ku Klux Klan or the Fascists? Moreover, if you accept the ordinary laws of science, you have to suppose that human life and life in general on this planet will die out in due course: it is a stage in the decay of the solar system; at a certain stage of decay you get the sort of conditions of temperature and so forth which are suitable to protoplasm, and there is life for a short time in the life of the whole solar system. You see in the moon the sort of thing to which the earth is tending -- something dead, cold, and lifeless.<br><br>I am told that that sort of view is depressing, and people will sometimes tell you that if they believed that, they would not be able to go on living. Do not believe it; it is all nonsense. Nobody really worries much about what is going to happen millions of years hence. Even if they think they are worrying much about that, they are really deceiving themselves. They are worried about something much more mundane, or it may merely be a bad digestion; but nobody is really seriously rendered unhappy by the thought of something that is going to happen to this world millions and millions of years hence. Therefore, although it is of course a gloomy view to suppose that life will die out -- at least I suppose we may say so, although sometimes when I contemplate the things that people do with their lives I think it is almost a consolation it is not such as to render life miserable. It merely makes you turn your attention to other things.<br><br><i>The Moral Arguments for Deity</i><br><br>Now we reach one stage further in what I shall call the intellectual descent that the Theists have made in their argumentations, and we come to what are called the moral arguments for the existence of God. You all know, of course, that there used to be in the old clays three intellectual arguments for the existence of God, all of which were disposed of by Immanuel Kant in the <i>Critique of Pure Reason;</i> but no sooner had he disposed of those arguments than he invented a new one, a moral argument, and that quite convinced him. He was like many people: in intellectual matters he was skeptical, but in moral matters he believed implicitly in the maxims that he had imbibed at his mother's knee. That illustrates what the psychoanalysts so much emphasize -- the immensely stronger hold upon us that our very early associations have than those of later times.<br><br>Kant, as I say, invented a new moral argument for the existence of God, and that in varying forms was extremely popular during the nineteenth century. It has all sorts of forms. One form is to say that there would be no right or wrong unless God existed. I am not for the moment concerned with whether there is a difference between right and wrong, or whether there is not: that is another question. The point I am concerned with is that, if you are quite sure there is a difference between right and wrong, you are then in this situation: Is that difference due to God's fiat or is it not? If it is due to God's fiat, then for God himself there is no difference between right and wrong, and it is no longer a significant statement to say that God i...</p><h2>Sermons of George Whitefield</h2><p>Revivalist and preacher George Whitefield was born on December 16, 1714, in Gloucester, England. The youngest of seven children, he was only two when his father died. His widowed mother struggled to provide for her family, and George left school for a time to help her. Little is known of his school days other than the fact that his rhetoric and memory were notable. <p> He eventually finished grammar school and enrolled at Oxford at the age of 17. Those university years became the turning point of his life. Drawn into a group called the "Holy Club," he met John and Charles Wesley and was converted to Christ in 1735. Whitefield was ordained in 1736 when he completed his Oxford degree. </p><p> The first of his many trips to America was made in 1738, when he spent a short time in Georgia in the mission post vacated by John Wesley. Returning to England, Whitefield found that his connection with the Wesleys and the evangelical character of his preaching had erased his popularity with Church of England clerics. Excluded from their pulpits, Whitefield began a series of open-air meetings in Bristol, moving on to exhort tens of thousands of people in London's Moorfields and Kennington Common. He persuaded John Wesley to carry on the work, and he returned to America, where he was an influential figure in the Great Awakening. </p><p> Whitefield was an astounding preacher from the beginning. Though slender of build, he stormed in the pulpit as if he were a giant. It was said that "his voice startled England like a trumpet blast." His messages were gospel-focused, simple and clear, bold, descriptive, earnest, and filled with pathos and emotion. Some calculate that he preached more than 18,000 sermons--and fewer than ninety have survived in any form.

I could not be more excited about these sermons being back in print. One can only pray that the same Lord who used these sermons to shake the world so long ago will give us another Great Awakening through them. Whitefield&#x2019;s own prayer for these sermons would surely accord with what he said when he gave the leadership of the Methodist movement to Wesley, 'Let the name of Whitefield perish, if only the name of Christ be glorified.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Jason C.

Well, I am sure it would have been amazing to hear him preach; but, given that, I find the written sermons to have an intrinsic fervor, power, clarity, and theological pungency that still leaps off the page into the conscience and affections in a gripping and edifying way. This publication is welcome; it will do us good and demonstrates once again that God&#x2019;s truth transcends all generations and cultures and that God only rarely gives gifts to the church as transparently good as George Whitefield.

In this business fable, Harvard Business School professor and bestselling author Deepak Malhotra encourages readers to control your own destiny rather than chase blindly after it.</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> If you were a mouse trapped in a maze and someone kept moving the cheese, what would you do?<br> &nbsp;<br> Over a decade ago the bestselling business fable <i>Who Moved My Cheese?</i> offered its answer to this question: accept that change is inevitable and beyond your control, don&#x2019;t waste your time wondering why things are the way they are, keep your head down, and start looking for the cheese.<br> &nbsp;<br> But success depends on the ability to push the boundaries, reshape the environment, and play by a different set of rules: our own. With that in mind, Deepak Malhotra offers a radically different answer to this question through an inspiring story about three unique and adventurous mice&#x2014;Max, Big, and Zed&#x2014;who refuse to accept their reality as given. As we watch their lives unfold and intersect, we discover that instead of just blindly chasing after the cheese, each of us has the ability to escape the maze or even reconfigure it to our liking.<br> &nbsp;<br> We often underestimate our ability to control our own destiny and overcome the constraints we face&#x2014;or think we face. <i>I Moved Your Cheese</i> reminds us that we can create the new circumstances and realities we want, but first we must discard the often deeply ingrained notion that we are nothing more than mice in someone else&#x2019;s maze. As Zed explains, &#x201c;You see, Max, the problem is not that the mouse is in the maze, but that the maze is in the mouse.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Deepak Malhotra</b> is the Eli Goldston Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School. He is an advisor to firms around the globe and coauthor (with Max Bazerman) of <i>Negotiation Genius</i>.THE GOOD BOOK<br><br> They called it a revolution. The lesson&#x2014;the insight&#x2014;had spread throughout the maze. Scarcely a mouse remained who had not heard what was contained in the good book.<br><br> The insight was profound. More importantly, it did not rely too much on one&#x2019;s ability to reason. And any mouse will tell you that this attribute is the hallmark of all great truths. So it was accepted as perhaps the greatest, and certainly the most important, truth. And it was all so simple.<br><br> The book made it clear: Change happens. You can sit there and complain about it, or you can change with the times. Do not fear change. Accept change. What happens in the maze is beyond your control. What you can control is your reaction.<br><br> Now, just because every mouse had come to understand this insight does not mean that every one of them was able to adopt it in practice. Some succeeded fully. They learned that change is inevitable and uncontrollable. They accepted that they were helpless to control the workings of the maze&#x2014;fate, they called it&#x2014;and they pledged to adapt.<br><br> Many others succeeded to a lesser degree. They still had moments of fear, immobility, depression, and despair. But such moments were less frequent than in the past. These mice improved their lot in the maze considerably.<br><br> To be sure, there were also mice who rarely thought about what the good book taught them. They agreed with it in principle but did not have the time or energy to change their ways. After all, habits are hard to break. They would work on it later&#x2014;maybe next week, maybe next year.<br><br> Overall, life in the maze was now quite different. In the past, when cheese moved from one location to another, all the mice were in despair. They could not understand what happened. They cursed their luck. They sat and waited in the cheese corner of the past and prayed for its return. They got agitated and lost their temper. They got angry and made an already difficult life even worse.<br><br> Now, after reading the good book, the mice reacted differently. The disappearance of the cheese was still traumatic, and it was still impossible to understand why the cheese had moved. But now the mice began to go in search of new cheese depots. Those who had fully adopted the good book&#x2019;s philosophy were the first to set about in search of the new cheese.<br><br> Those who struggled with the philosophy, who found it difficult to break old habits, were slower to move. But they, too, understood that they had to change with changing times. They, too, eventually went to look for more cheese.<br><br> By learning to change with changing times, the mice succeeded in finding more cheese. They found it more quickly than they had ever done in the past. The good book was right! They had cheese ... more cheese, and sooner than ever before. It does not get much better than that if you are a mouse.<br><br> And so the mice no longer questioned why the cheese moved. Everyone agreed that such questions had no answers. They did not try to devise plans to try to stop the cheese from moving. Only a fool would think that fate could be controlled. Above all, they never again asked the unreasonable question, &#x201c;Who moved my cheese?&#x201d;<br><br> Life was simpler now. It all came down to a very simple equation:<br><br> You want cheese<br> +<br> The cheese is no longer here<br> = Go elsewhere to find the cheese.<br><br> After all, for a mouse in a maze, cheese is really all that matters.<br><br> But then ...<br><br> Well ... then there was Max.<br><br> And Max was altogether different.</p><h2>Reading Book for Human Relations Training, Eighth Edition</h2><p>Contains nearly 70 articles covering nine topics in human relations written by highly regarded behavioral science scholars and practitioners.

Since then, his continued investigations into printmaking have produced an innovative body of work that is as large as it is varied. While Serra&#39;s prints explore the perceptual possibilities suggested by his sculptural work, they are not merely illustrative, but rather autonomous works of art that constantly push the medium to its limits. Conveying a sense of weight, instability, and potential motion, Serra&#39;s graphic works possess a physical presence that provokes reactions similar to those experienced in the presence of his sculptures. Rounding out the publication&#39;s visuals, two essayists explore the many ramifications of presence in Serra&#39;s work.</p><p></p><h2>No Photos on the Dance Floor!: Berlin 1989 &#x2013; Today</h2><p><b>From photography of dance floors with strobe lights and smoke machine haze to intimidating bouncers and after-party exhaustion, this thrilling book portrays three decades of Berlin's club scene.</b><br><br>It's 1989. The Berlin Wall has fallen and the city's youth are tasting a new found freedom. Throughout Europe, electronic dance music is powering nightclubs and fueling day-long raves, which makes Berlin--a city hit by economic hardship and with acres of empty warehouses and factories--the perfect incubator for an underground music scene. This book brings that scene, which had continued for nearly three decades, to life. Taking its name from a strict ban on cameras in the city's nightclubs, this book documents Berlin's club culture. Martin Eberle take readers inside the empty rooms of clubs like Tresor, Panasonic, Ibiza, and Dirt while portraits from his "After Show" series capture moments of exhaustion, excitement, and excess. Legendary photographer Wolfgang Tillmans offers images that span a generation of young people living out their sexual, political, and personal freedom. Contemporary photography by Camille Blake and George Nebieridze documents queer events like Herrensauna, Trade, and Pornceptual. Sven Marquardt's black-and-white portraits of bouncers and barkeepers at Berghain focus on those outside the spotlight. Finally, Erez Israeli and Mike Riemel show admission stamps and a selection of flyers for Berlin raves--the only things you can take home after a night out without breaking the photography ban. Essays and personal interviews, scattered throughout this volume, create a backdrop that traces the history of club life in Berlin and describe the heady sense of utopian promise and the energy that sustained the culture for decades.</p><p>FELIX HOFFMANN is Chief Curator of C/O Berlin in Berlin.<br><br>HEIKO HOFFMANN is a curator and journalist and has taught at the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music at New York University in New York City.</p><h2>Plain Lives in a Golden Age: Popular Culture, Religion and Society in Seventeenth-Century Holland</h2><p>st comprehensive study yet published of the plain lives of a &#39;golden age&#39;.f plague from the first outbreak of the Black Death in 1348 to the mid-fifteenth century.

What links the work of Strindberg, Artaud, Brook and Mnouchkine is an idealisation of the elemental and a desire to find ritual in archaic traditions. This widespread primitivism is the key to understanding both the political and aesthetic aspects of modern theatre and provides fresh insights into contemporary social trends. <br> The original text, first published in 1981 as <em>Holy Theatre</em>, has been fully revised and up-dated to take account of the most recent theoretical developments in anthropology, critical theory and psychotherapy. New sections on Heiner Muller, Robert Wilson, Eugenio Barba, Ariane Mnouchkine and Sam Shepard have been added. As a result, the book now deals with all the major avant garde theatre practitioners, in Europe and North America.<br> <em>Avant Garde Theatre</em> will be essential reading for anyone attempting to understand contemporary drama.</p><p>Christopher Innes is Professor of English at York University, Ontario."Christopher Innes's encyclopedic "Avant Garde Theatre, 1892-1992, creates order out of theories, movements, cults, groups, and writers from the canonical, like Strindberg and Pirandello, to the most "anthropological" of experimenters like Eugenio Barba. It is difficult to imagine the need for any other survey of the topic, though Innes is no mere cartographer. With his customary intelligence and clarity, Innes identifies the principles that unify as well as those that distinguish avant gardism from modernism or postmodernism, avoiding the latter terms as far as possible.

With Greek or Latin text on the left and English translation on the facing page, it provides quick, consistent and user-friendly access to a wide range of authors, and does not discriminate between those who want to read in the original and those who just want an English version...Alan Sommerstein's three-volume Aeschylus...is in many respects the best critical edition of this playwright available in any format. Sommerstein's authority as a linguist and expert in Aeschylean drama is second to none, and he has provided an up-to-date and carefully constituted text for the seven surviving plays, plus all of the fragmentary remains that are at least one line long.

Particularly welcome is the well-documented and clearly presented volume of <i>Fragments</i>--for of course the seven plays we happen to possess are by no means all that Aeschylus wrote, and not necessarily even the seven best: the trilogies dealing with Achilles at Troy, or with Pentheus and the Bacchants, for example, seem to have been especially daring and influential.

Some 10,000 years ago bands of hunter-gatherers started to abandon their high-mobility lifestyles in favour of growing crops, and the creation of settled, sedentary communities. This settlement in favour of the agricultural lifestyle triggered the evolution of complex political and economic structures, and technological developments, and ultimately underpinned the rise of all the great civilisations of recent human history. <em>Domestication of plants in the Old World </em>reviews the origin and spread of cultivation in south-west Asia, Europe, and north-east Africa, from the very earliest beginnings. This new edition incorporates the most recent findings from molecular biology about the genetic relations between domesticated plants and their wild ancestors; it adds material on several new crop plants; and it incorporates extensive new archaeological data about the spread of agriculture within the region. The reference list has been completely updated, as have the list of archaeological sites and the site maps.<br><br> <strong>From reviews of the second edition:</strong> 'This book is indeed a "mine of information".

Beginning with her earliest works drawings and paintings created in the 1940s while studying at Black Mountain College this beautifully illustrated volume traces Asawa&#x2019;s trajectory as a pioneering modernist sculptor who is recognized nationally for her wire sculpture, public commissions, and activism in education and the arts.<i> The Sculpture of Ruth Asawa </i>establishes the importance of Asawa&#x2019;s work within the larger national context of artists who redefined art as a way of thinking and acting in the world rather than as merely a stylistic practice. A chronology and a collection of essays by noted scholars highlight Asawa&#x2019;s complex relationship to American art and Asian American history and provide engrossing biographical information.<br><br> In her lifelong experimentations with wire, especially its capacity to balance open and closed forms, Asawa invented a powerful new vocabulary. Committed to enhancing the quality of daily life through art produced within the home, she contributed a unique perspective to the formal explorations of twentieth-century abstract sculpture. Working in a variety of non-traditional media, Asawa performed a series of uncanny metamorphoses, leading viewers into a deeper awareness of natural forms by revealing their structural properties. Through her artistic practice, Asawa reconnects with the Buddhist ethos of her parents, transforming the commonplace into metaphors for life processes themselves.<br><br><i>Essays by Daniell Cornell, Emily Doman, Mary Emma Harris, Karin Higa, Jacqueline Hoefer, John Kriedler, Susan Stauter, and Sally Woodbridge</i><br><i>Copub: Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco </i></p><p><b>Daniell Cornell </b>is Curator and Director of Contemporary Art Projects at the de Young Museum.&#x201c;The first major efforts to reevaluate the art of Ruth Asawa. . . .

Fish swim by moving their body from side to side. Some swim slowly by moving their fins. Most fish, however, use their fins only to steer and keep themselves from rolling onto their side as they swim. Almost all fish have a swim bladder, a balloon-like organ that helps them float. When a fish lets air into its swim bladder, its body rises in the water. When it lets in water, its body sinks.A good introduction to the animal kingdom for the younger child.

It is drawn from a rare journal, one of many kept by Mathias Hovius from 1596 to 1620 while he was Archbishop of Mechelen (part of modern Belgium). Elegantly written, the book focuses not only on the life of Mathias Hovius but also on key events and characters of his time; it portrays &#x201c;lived religion,&#x201d; so that we see people from all sides getting involved in the constant negotiation of what it meant to be a good Catholic.<br><br>Craig Harline and Eddy Put recreate the eventful life and times of Mathias Hovius&#x2015;a world in which other-believers were outright heretics, the nagging fevers of old age were the result of unbalanced bodily humors, and a corruptible earth rested motionless at the center of the universe while God sat exalted on a throne just beyond the fixed stars. The authors also tell the stories of monks, nuns, priests, millers, pilgrims, peasant women, saints, town and village councils, and ordinary parishioners; each story, fascinating in its own right, illustrates a major theme in the history of the Catholic Reformation. In the end Harline and Put have painted a picture teeming with life and energy.</p><p>In 1987, Craig Harline, professor of history at Brigham Young University, and Eddy Put, senior assistant at the Belgian National Archives, struck gold. In a dusty Belgian archive, they found a detailed daybook kept by Mathias Hovius, who served as archbishop of Mechelen (part of modern Belgium) from 1596 to 1620. Harline and Put spent the next 13 years turning that daybook into <i>A Bishop's Tale: Mathias Hovius Among His Flock in Seventeenth-Century Flanders</i>, an extraordinary work of historical biography. <p> It would be difficult to overstate the pleasures of this book. Its historical method is unusually accessible and sophisticated. ("In seeking to understand a world long past, we found it highly illuminating to begin with a single human being rather than a large abstraction such as 'society.'") Its style is straightforward and novelistic, with a wealth of detail that humanizes its exotic subjects. (For instance, the archbishop had "no protruding hairs on his upper lip, lest while celebrating Mass he obstruct the blood of Christ.") Even individual sentences often display a stunning, wide-angled perspective on individual events.

And its characters--monks, nuns, millers, peasants, saints, who incidentally illustrate major themes of the Reformation-- are vital and ribald and doomed and striving. Harline and Put say they chose to write about the Reformation because of "its massive rupturing of a seemingly eternal premise of Christianity: that it was one." In an afterword, Harline and Put explain that "Never before had there been such widespread teaching, preaching, and fighting over souls, or such excellent preservation on paper of these efforts. Rich documents are often the fruit of zeal." The authors' own zeal to show readers the world of this bishop has created a very rich book about Reformation Christianity. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i></p>"Truly remarkable. . . .

In the state's complex loyalties, its sprawling and diverse geography, and its dual role as a home front and a battlefield, North Carolina embodies the essence of the whole epic struggle in all its terrible glory.<br><br>Philip Gerard presents this dramatic convergence of events through the stories of the individuals who endured them--reporting the war as if it were happening in the present rather than with settled hindsight--to capture the dreadful suspense of lives caught up in a conflict whose ending had not yet been written. As Gerard reveals, whatever the grand political causes for war, whatever great battles decided its outcome, and however abstract it might seem to readers a century and a half later, the war was always personal.<br><br></p><p>Philip Gerard is professor of creative writing at the University of North Carolina Wilmington.

Drawing together the threads of current research on the nature and funactions of emotional expression, of physiological reactions, and of emotional experience, this book offers a balanced survey of facts and theory. Nico Frijda discusses the motivational and neurophysiological preconditions for emotions, and the ways in which emotions are regulated by the individual. Considering the kinds of events that elicit emotions, he argues that emotions arise because events are appraised by people as favorable or harmful to their own interests. he takes an information-processing perspective: Emotions are viewed as outcomes of the process of assessing the world in terms of one&#39;s own concerns, which, in turn, modify action readiness. This analysis leads him to address such fundamental issues as the place of emotion in motivation generally and the discrepancy between the functions of the emotions and their often irrational and disruptive character. An important contribution to recent debates, The Emotions does not presuppose extensive prior knowledge.</p><p>What are &#39;emotions&#39;?

These four volumes on physical chemistry combine a clear and thorough presentation of the theoretical and mathematical aspects of the subject with examples and applications drawn from current industrial and academic research. By using the computer to solve problems that include actual experimental data, the author is able to cover the subject matter at a practical level. The books closely integrate the theoretical chemistry being taught with industrial and laboratory practice. This approach enables the student to compare theoretical projections with experimental results, thereby providing a realistic grounding for future practicing chemists and engineers. Each volume of Physical Chemistry includes Mathematica� and Mathcad� Workbooks on CD-ROM.<br><br>Metiu's four separate volumes-Thermodynamics, Statistical Mechanics, Kinetics, and Quantum Mechanics-offer built-in flexibility by allowing the subject to be covered in any order.These textbooks can be used to teach physical chemistry without a computer, but the experience is enriched substantially for those students who do learn how to read and write Mathematica� or Mathcad� programs. A TI-89 scientific calculator can be used to solve most of the exercises and problems.<br>� Mathematica is a registered trademark of Wolfram Research, Inc.<br>� Mathcad is a registered trademark of Mathsoft Engineering &amp; Education, Inc.<br></p><p><strong> </strong><p><strong>Horia Metiu</strong> is Professor of Chemistry and Physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He received his Ph.D. from MIT in 1974. Prof. Metiu has won several Camille and Henry Dreyfus Teacher-Scholar awards and is a former Alfred P. Sloan Fellow. He received the Exxon Solid State Chemistry ACS Award, the UCSB Faculty Research Lectureship, and a Senior Humboldt Award. Prof. Metiu is Associate Editor for the <em>Journal of Chemical Physics</em> and a fellow of the American Physical Society and Japan Association for the Promotion of Science. </p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Horia Metiu has created a significant set of volumes on undergraduate physical chemistry. The integration of Mathematica and Mathcad workbooks into the four texts provides instructors with an attractive new option in teaching. Metiua's writing style is folksy and the graphics minimal, a refreshing approach�.Taken as a whole, the four volumes on physical chemistry by Metiu are impressive, particularly <em>Thermodynamics</em> and <em>Quantum Mechanics</em>�.Without a doubt, the four textbooks provide essential materials of great utility to physical chemistry instructors. The bottom line is that the set of four volumes is a must have-a keeper- as a novel resource or invaluable classroom tool. <p>Journal of Chemical Education</p> <p>February 2008, Vol. 85, No. 2, p. 206</p></p><h2>Vietnam at War: The History: 1946-1975</h2><p>Weaving together the histories of three distinct conflicts, Phillip B. Davidson follows the entire course of the Vietnam War, from the initial French skirmishes in 1946 to the dramatic fall of Saigon nearly thirty years later. His connecting thread is North Vietnamese General Vo Nguyen Giap, a remarkable figure who, with no formal military training, fashioned a rag-tag militia into one of the world's largest and most formidable armies. By focusing on Giap's role throughout the war, and by making available for the first time a wealth of recently declassified North Vietnamese documents, Davidson offers unprecedented insight into Hanoi's military strategies, an insight surpassed only by his inside knowledge of American operations and planning.<br> Eminently qualified to write this history, Davidson--who served as chief intelligence officer under Generals Westmoreland and Abrams--tells firsthand the story of our tragic ordeal in Indochina and brings his unique understanding to bear on topics of continuing controversy, offering a chilling account, for example, of when and where the U.S. considered using nuclear weapons. The most comprehensive and authoritative history of the conflict to date, <em>Vietnam at War</em> sparkles with a rare immediacy, and brings to life in compelling fashion the war that tore America apart. We witness the chaos in Saigon when fireworks celebrating the Tet holiday are suddenly transformed into deadly rocket and machine-gun fire. We sit in on high-level meetings where General Westmoreland plans operations, or simply engages in some tough "headknocking" with subordinates. And in the end we learn that even the seemingly limitless resources of the U.S. military could not match the revolutionary "grand strategy" of the North Vietnamese.<br> With its easy movement from intimate memoir to trenchant military analysis, from the conference rooms of generals to the battle-scarred streets of Hue, this is military history at its most gripping. A monumental, engrossing, and unforgettable chronicle, <em>Vietnam at War</em> is indispensable for anyone hoping to understand a conflict that still rages in the American psyche.<br></p><p><br><strong>Phillip B. Davidson</strong>, a retired Army lieutenant general, not only spent two years in Vietnam as the chief intelligence officer to Generals Westmoreland and Abrams, but prior to that was Assistant Professor of Military History at West Point. The editors of <em>Encyclopedia Britannica</em> have recently commissioned him to rewrite their entry on the Vietnam War.<br><br>"Davidson has accomplished a major fete in describing the military history of both the first and second Vietnam War.

This book is based on an earlier book, <em>Your Memory, </em>which was intended for the general public, but began to be used as a basic memory text, thus encouraging the development of the present revised textbook version. <em>Essentials of Human Memory </em>combines coverage of the fundamental issues of human memory, based on laboratory research with abundant illustrations from studies in the real world and in the neuropsychological clinic, where dramatic memory deficits have continued to throw light on our understanding of normal memory.<br>After a broad overview of approaches to the study of memory, short-term and working memory are discussed, followed by learning, the role of organizing in remembering and factors influencing forgetting, including emotional variables and claims for the role of repression in what has become known as the false memory syndrome. The way in which knowledge of the world is stored is discussed next, followed by an account of the processes underlying retrieval, and their application to the practical issues of eyewitness testimony. The breakdown of memory in the amnesic syndrome is discussed next, followed by discussion of the way in which memory develops in children, and declines in the elderly. After a section concerned with mnemonic techniques and memory improvement, the book ends with an overview of recent developments in the field of human memory.</p><p><p>Alan&nbsp;Baddeley was&nbsp;Director MRC Applied Psychology Unit Cambridge from 1974 to1995 and is now Professor of Psychology at the University of York</p><em>'The book is based on Baddeley's previous popular book, 'Your Memory: A User's Guide', and he has managed to retain the chatty, interactive style of that book whilst increasing the academic content considerably.

Naime, Purdue University, in APA Review of Books<br></strong><br><em>'Although a basic text for psychology undergraduates, this book is very accessible to a more general readership. It achieves this through an informal reading style, crammed with anecdotes and fascinating experiments, many of which the reader can perform on themselves to learn more about their own memory systems.

Most usefully translated as a hymn or song of praise, "Cantico" is an antidote to today's world of doubts, fears, conflicts and seductive philosophies of despair. The attitude to life it holds out to its readers is summed up in the epitaph on Guillen's tomb in the English cemetery in Malaga: "Aqui yace un enamorado de la vida" ("Here lies a lover of life").</p></p><p></p><h2>Gestalt Approaches in Counseling</h2><p>An introductory survey of the theoretical dimensions of Gestalt therapy, with exercises intended to facilitate the reader&#39;s self-awareness and of various Gestalt approaches suitable for practicing counselors and trainees.

Island communities are defined by their isolation, and as the isolation is penetrated the definition changes: whales, railroads, and tourists have brought Nantucket by turns prosperity, depression, and prosperity once again; yet the great fact of Nantucket, to the delight of visitors, residents, and historic preservationists, is that change has left it all but <i>unchanged</i>. While industrial progress has decimated America&#x2019;s heritage almost everywhere, Nantucket has not only maintained its buildings, beaches, and landscapes, but largely improved upon them.<br>Proof? Compare these 210 past and present photographs, and read how one island escaped the blight of modern times and thrives on its preserved heritage.<br>John McCalley researched and collected rare stereographs and old photographs of Nantucket topography and urban views, then took new photographs from the same perspectives. The result is a visually documented contradiction: Nantucket absorbing the modern era yet remaining untouched. Compare Quidnet 1870 with Quidnet a century later &#x2014; the former fishing village is today a summer colony, yet construction style and size have not altered, the greatest change being ubiquitous power lines. Compare Old South Wharf early this century with today &#x2014; the scale is the same, though the outdated dock has become a modern marina. Examine the old homes along India, Orange, and Main Streets &#x2014; some of the ornament removed, bits of clapboard replaced by shingle, but clearly circumstance combined with Nantucketers&#x2019; preservation consciousness has preserved an atmosphere once common to the eastern seaboard, now unique to the island. Hundreds of other comparative photographs, including reviews of Josiah Freeman&#x2019;s and Henry S. Wyer&#x2019;s panoramic shots from church towers, provide a photographic essay in historical geography and a landscape&#x2019;s almost hidden evolution. John McCalley&#x2019;s detailed captions and fervent commentary give Nantucket&#x2019;s history without the sentimental whaling myths, offering thoughtful observation on the value of isolated Nantucket and the need for watchful care.<br>Nantucketers are not the only ones who will want to view and read about the summer homes, hotels, public buildings, streets, the waterfront, and countryside of old and new Nantucket. Historians, geographers, students of Americana and all interested in the preservation of a fragile past will find this an engaging, thought-provoking work.</p><p></p><h2>Western Civilizations: Their History and Their Culture</h2><p><p><strong>The best western civilizations text for emphasizing critical thinking, now in a brief edition.</strong></p> Master teachers and scholars, new co-authors Joshua Cole and Carol Symes integrate new and innovative pedagogical tools based on their own teaching experiences into this best-selling brief text to help students think critically, retain key information, and make connections.</p><p><p><strong>Joshua Cole</strong> is Professor of History at the University of Michigan.

Damaged at the start of World War I, it fell into disrepair . . . until the Nazis took it over after their invasion of Belgium in 1940. Never designated an official concentration camp by the SS and instead labeled a "reception" camp where prisoners were held until they were either released or transported, Breendonk was no less brutal. About 3,600 prisoners were held there--just over half of them survived. As one prisoner put it, "I would prefer to spend nineteen months at Buchenwald than nineteen days at Breendonk."&nbsp;With access to the camp and its archives and with rare photos and artwork, James M. Deem pieces together the story of the camp by telling the stories of its victims--Jews, communists, resistance fighters, and common criminals--for the first time in an English-language publication. Leon Nolis's haunting photography of the camp today accompanies the wide range of archival images.&nbsp;The story of Breendonk is one you will never forget.&nbsp;</p><p>James M. Deem is the author of numerous books for young readers, including <i>3 NB of Julian Drew,</i> <i>Bodies from the Ice: Melting Glaciers and the Rediscovery of the Past</i>, and <i>Faces From the Past</i>.

Line notes printed at the bottom of the page bring a reader further quick assistance. . . . The choral odes as rendered here deserve special notice. After giving a succinct analysis of each in his introduction, Woodruff translates the lyrics into English that is both poetic and comprehensible. . . . Woodruff's rendering of the dialogue moves along easily; these are lines that any contemporary Antigone, Creon or Haemon might speak. Antigone's words on the gods' unwritten laws keep close to the Greek and yet would be authentic for a modern speaker. . . . Woodruff's introduction is a strong, clear, and clever blend of basic traditional information (to those who know Greek tragedy) and fresh insights. . . .

The first section is composed of 100 stories and 26 critical essays. The stories are organized alphabetically by author. The narratives represent diverse types of fiction ranging from antiquity to the present, such as Luke's parable, Galeano's fable, Calvino's folktale, Wilde's prose poem, Mann's sketch, Theroux's humor, Maupassant's satire, Moore's realism, S. L. Wisenberg's naturalism, Garcia Mdrquez's magical realism, Frame's fantasy, Le Guin's allegory, Bukowski's dramatic monologue, Woolf's experimental prose, Lispector's stream of consciousness, and Poe's gothic horror. Among the internationally acclaimed authors are Pulitzer Prize winner Eudora Welty, James Joyce, and Nobel laureate Naguib Mafouz, as well as three of the finest writers of this relatively new genre: Yasunari Kawabata, H. H. Munro, and Amy Hemple. Many of the stories will serve as engaging introductions to the authors' longer works. For example, there are pieces by Alice Walker, Marcel Proust, Vladimir Nabokov, Fyodor Dostoevsky and Herman Melville. The rich diversity of excellent literature is designed to provide a global array of choices that peak your students' imagination and desire to write creatively. </p> <p> The first-person and commentary essays by distinguished writers and scholars appear immediately after their corresponding stories. In many cases, these essays explicate the writers' motivation and stylistic choices, enabling students to better understand how stylistic elements&#x2014;such as character, dialogue, and mood&#x2014;work seamlessly with the governing pattern of the whole to engage the reader and achieve the writer's predetermined goal. You may want to direct students' attention to how the writers dispense with impedimenta to craft lean subtle prose, how they pare the narrative down to its most salient details, thereby achieving economy and grace. </p> <p> The second section is a stylistic table of contents listing each story by one of the three stylistic devices that dominate this often quickly paced form: voice, point of view, and setting. The section that follows is a Top Ten, if you will, of guidelines for crafting a very short story. More suggestive than prescriptive, it is meant to stimulate thought about stylistic choices as students embark on the creative process. The fourth section comprises 20 exercises that will challenge students' ability to craft succinct narratives that balance emotional pitch and intellectual power. </p> <p> The above-mentioned literary terms, as well as others, can be found in the glossary, the text's last section. </p> <p> I must thank certain individuals whose sage counsel has been invaluable throughout the development of <i>Crafting,</i> from its embryonic form to its final proofing: Halina Makowska, whose tact, incisiveness, and translation services were without peer; the exemplary design and edit staff at Prentice Hall, Pearson Education, from Thomas DeMarco and Carrie L.

The debate about why the fortunes of cities such as Detroit have fallen looms large over questions of social policy. In <i>Manufacturing Decline</i>, Jason Hackworth offers a powerful critique of the role of Rust Belt cities in American political discourse, arguing that antigovernment conservatives capitalized on&#x2015;and perpetuated&#x2015;these cities&#x2019; misfortunes by stoking racial resentment.<br><br>Hackworth traces how the conservative movement has used the imagery and ideas of urban decline since the 1970s to advance their cause. Through a comparative study of shrinking Rust Belt cities, he argues that the rhetoric of the troubled &#x201c;inner city&#x201d; has served as a proxy for other social conflicts around race and class. In particular, conservatives have used images of urban decay to craft &#x201c;dog-whistle&#x201d; messages to racially resentful whites, garnering votes for the Republican Party and helping justify limits on local autonomy in distressed cities. The othering of predominantly black industrial cities has served as the basis for disinvestment and deprivation that exacerbated the flight of people and capital. Decline, Hackworth contends, was manufactured both literally and rhetorically in an effort to advance austerity and punitive policies. Weaving together analyses of urban policy, movement conservatism, and market fundamentalism, <i>Manufacturing Decline</i> highlights the central role of racial reaction in creating the problems American cities still face.</p><p>Jason Hackworth is a professor in the Department of Geography and Planning at the University of Toronto. He is the author of <i>The Neoliberal City: Governance, Ideology, and Development in American Urbanism</i> (2007) and <i>Faith Based: Religious Neoliberalism and the Politics of Welfare in the United States</i> (2012).<i>Manufacturing Decline </i>is a sobering yet essential read for anyone who is interested in the fate of America&#x2019;s inner cities. This recovery of the politics behind&#x2015;and, indeed, that created&#x2015;the devastating decline of key cities such as Detroit is deeply unsettling but ultimately uplifting. As Jason Hackworth makes clear, just as America&#x2019;s inner cities can be deliberately unmade to serve the political agenda of conservatives, so might they be remade in ways that could actually benefit all citizens equally. (Heather Ann Thompson, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of <i>Blood in the Water: The Attica Prison Uprising of 1971 and Its Legacy</i>)<br><br><i>Manufacturing Decline</i> implicates conservative thought leadership, anti-urban interests, and elite&#x2015;and ordinary&#x2015;laissez-faire racism in a deliberate, decades-long degradation of U.S. cities via privation, demolition, and desertion. It is a thoughtful, stimulating, and efficient read at the intersection of urban geography, planning, and the social sciences. (Michael Leo Owens, author of <i>God and Government in the Ghetto: The Politics of Church-State Collaboration in Black America</i>)<br><br><i>Manufacturing Decline</i> convincingly argues that, while the disappearance of manufacturing jobs affected Rust Belt cities, their decline was not inevitable. Jason Hackworth provides a marvelous exposition of how this decline was largely produced by the rise of neoliberal policies emphasizing free markets while deliberately overlooking the region&#x2019;s long history of racial disparities.

But there is nothing sentimental about Moll, who presents herself warts and all. Though her adventures take her abroad, she remains the vivid creation of London.<p>Moll Flanders, pickpocket and prostitute&#x2013;a mercantile genius trading in the oldest human commodity&#x2013;has been for the past three centuries an enduring representative of reckless vitality combined with unshakable inner virtue. Daniel Defoe manages his story with such skill that our affection for his heroine increases with each astonishing sin she commits.<br><br>Moll&#x2019;s adventures&#x2013;possibly taken by Defoe from the story of some real criminal he met in Newgate, who &#x201c;five times a wife, twelve year a thief, eight year a transported felon, at last grew rich, lived honest and died a penitent&#x201d;&#x2013;is told with the directness of narrative and reality of incident in which Defoe, often called the father of the novel, has never been equaled.<br><br>(Book Jacket Status: Not Jacketed)<br>&nbsp;<br><br></p></p><p>The recent adaptation of <b>Moll Flanders</b> for Masterpiece Theater is a book-lover's dream: the dialogue and scene arrangement are close enough to allow the viewer to follow along in the book. The liberties taken with the tale are few (some years of childhood between the gypsies and the wealthy family are elided; Moll is Moll throughout the tale, rather than Mrs. Betty; Robert becomes Rowland, etc.) and the sets avoid the careless anachronism of the movie version released earlier this year. <p> The breasts, raised skirts, tumbling hair and heavy breathing on the small screen might catch you by surprise if you don't read the book carefully (as might Moll's abandonment of her children on more than one occasion). Unlike his near-contemporary John Cleland (_Fanny Hill_), Defoe was trying to keep out of jail, and so didn't dwell on the details of "correspondence" between Moll and her varied lovers. But on the page and on the screen, Moll comes across quite clearly as a woman who might bend, but refuses to break, and who is intent on having as good a life as she can get. </p><p> E. M. Forster in Aspects of the Novel considers Moll and her creator's art in some detail. While he finds much to criticize in Defoe's ability to plot (where did those last two children go, anyway?), he is as besotted with Moll as I am. Immoral? Sure -- but immortal, and never, ever dull. We hope at least a few of the viewers of the recent adaptation take a couple hours to discover the original, inimitable Moll Flanders.</p>Founded in 1906 by J.M.

Today, new generations are finding his writings and lectures online, while faithful followers worldwide continue to be enlightened by his teachings. <em>The Collected Letters of Alan Watts </em>reveals the remarkable arc of Watts&#x2019;s colorful and controversial life, from his school days in England to his priesthood in the Anglican Church as chaplain of Northwestern University to his alternative lifestyle and experimentation with LSD in the heyday of the late sixties. His engaging letters cover a vast range of subject matter, with recipients ranging from High Church clergy to high priests of psychedelics, government officials, publishers, critics, family, and fans. They include C. G. Jung, Henry Miller, Gary Snyder, Aldous Huxley, Reinhold Niebuhr, Timothy Leary, Joseph Campbell, and James Hillman. Watts&#x2019;s letters were curated by two of his daughters, Joan Watts and Anne Watts, who have added rich, behind-the-scenes biographical commentary.<br> <br> <em>Edited by Joan Watts &amp; Anne Watts</em><em><br> <br> </em></p><p><strong>Alan Watts</strong> is best known as an interpreter of Zen Buddhism in particular and of Indian and Chinese philosophy in general. He earned the reputation of being one of the most original and unfettered philosophers of the twentieth century. He was the author of more than twenty books, including <em>The Way of Zen</em>, <em>The Wisdom of Insecurity</em>, <em>The Meaning of Happiness</em>, <em>Psychotherapy East and West</em>, <em>The Book</em>, <em>This Is It</em>,<em> The Joyous Cosmology</em>,<em> In My Own Way</em>, and <em>Tao,</em> <em>the Watercourse Way </em>(with Chungliang Al Huang).

It&#x2019;s called &#x201c;the law of diminishing returns.&#x2019;&#x2019; A brain that continues intact for 100, 500, or 1000 years is increasingly clogged with memories, and becomes like a sheet of paper so covered with writing that no space is left for any visible or intelligible form. Thus a human being 500 years old would be as inert as a turtle of the same age. </p><br><br><p>Consider the following points: (a) death is not a sickness or disease; it is an event as natural and as healthy as childbirth or as the falling of leaves in the autumn. (b) As the &#x201c;natural childbirth&#x201d; obstetricians are training women to experience the pains of labor as erotic tensions, there is no reason why the &#x201c;pangs of death&#x201d; should not be reinterpreted as the ecstasies of liberation from anxiety and overloads of memory and responsibility. (c) Suppose that medical science achieves a method of getting rid of the overload of memories and anxieties: isn&#x2019;t this what death accomplishes already? (d) The funk about death is the illusion that you are going to experience everlasting darkness and nothingness as if being buried alive. (e) The &#x201c;nothingness&#x201d; after death is the same as the &#x201c;nothingness&#x201d; before you were born, and because anything that has happened once can happen again you will happen again as you did before, mercifully freed from the boredom of an overloaded memory.</p><br><br><p>Along with most of us, Alan Harrington doesn&#x2019;t see that this &#x201c;nothingness&#x201d; before birth and after death is simply the temporal equivalent of, say, the space between stars. Where would stars be without spatial intervals between them? The problem is simply that civilized and brainwashed human beings lack the perception that we are all one Self, marvellously varied and indefinitely extended through time and space with restful intervals. As St. Thomas Aquinas said, &#x201c;It is the silent pause which gives sweetness to the chant.&#x201d; </p><br><br><p>Instead of trying to turn us into living mummies, the medical profession would be better advised to reform the present morbid rituals of dying in hospitals and turn them into celebrations in which the patient is encouraged to let go of himself by cooperating with death. You only die once, and why not make the best of it? </p><br><br><p>Alan Watts</p><br><br><p><b>To Harper&#x2019;s Magazine</b></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;...our police forces are being corrupted and diverted from their proper tasks of protecting life and property by being required to serve as armed clergymen enforcing sumptuary laws against &#x201c;crimes&#x201d; without complaining victims. It is no business of the government to interfere in matters of gambling, sexual morals, and the use of natural substances arbitrarily defined as &#x201c;drugs&#x201d; or &#x201c;narcotics.&#x201d; The work of our courts is clogged and our prisons overcrowded because of this ridiculous inquisition of private morals and tastes.</p><br><br><p>The second is that medical knowledge and expertise should be as freely available to the general public as the art of cooking. There are not enough qualified physicians and surgeons to serve our needs, with the result that doctors&#x2019; offices and hospitals are as overburdened as the courts of justice.</p><br><br><p>There are serious risks in adopting such a policy, but without risk there is no freedom, and the United States of America is supposed, above all things, to represent the principle of liberty&#x2015;the dangerous and splendid task of taking responsibility for your own life.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p><b>To Hugh T. Kerr, Princeton, New Jersey</b></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;I am not uptight about the Jesus freaks. I am simply and honestly angry. To be uptight about something is to pish-tush in a standoffish way. But my emotions seem to go naturally angry when people take on wallowing in guilt and anti-sexuality as a way of life and, furthermore, obscure the gospel by insisting that Jesus alone was the son of God. Biblical fundamentalism is, to me, the nastiest religion on earth (whether in its Protestant form or as Catholic Jansenism) because it underlies white racism and colonialism, prohibition, prudery, and, equally, leering pornography.</p><br><br><p>I am not afraid of tangling with fundamentalists. I am very used to it, since all my mother&#x2019;s brothers were of this persuasion, though she herself was more liberal and had the good sense to belong to the Anglican Communion.</p><br><br><p>At the same time, I can see Billy Graham or a Southern Baptist deaconess as very far-out manifestations of God playing not God, as performing the function of making sex fascinating by forbidding it, but&#x2015;for my taste&#x2015;this is an ugly trip. It ends up with requiring the police to be armed clergymen, and filling the jails with people who have committed &#x201c;crimes&#x201d; without victims, and my anger is one and the same process as their suffering.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p><b>To the Editor, Gourmet Magazine</b></p><br><br><p>If I were to have been told three or four years ago that I was to become a vegetarian, a fruitarian, and a nuts-and-cheese freak, I would have been horrified. For in those days I prided myself in preparing <i>boeuf tartare</i>, <i>pate de veau en croute</i>, <i>poupetons de dindon</i>, and a steak-and-kidney pie better than anything to be found in London.</p><br><br><p>But something has happened to our meat and poultry. The meat has become mere chewing stuff, and the poultry (in particular the breasts) has come to taste like <i>papier mache</i>. Some of my friends who are health-food aficionados say that this is because I have ruined my palate by smoking too many cigars and imbibing too much spiritous liquor. This is not true. Several years ago I imagined that this was the cause of my finding American potatoes (even the little new ones) entirely tasteless. But when, after twenty years absence, I returned to my father&#x2019;s garden in England, the potatoes were as delicious as when I had been a child.</p><br><br><p>So I have not destroyed my palate. The truth of the matter is that our edible animals are being raised in vast cellblocks under the superstition that almost anything fed, say, to a chicken will turn into chicken. Why, they are even scheming to breed featherless chickens to eliminate the plucking process!</p><br><br><p>The reason is simply that the food industries are owned by syndicates composed of barbarians who are interested in nothing more than making money. Being barbarians, they do not understand that huge sums of money become increasingly worthless when there is no food on the market except the fraudulent plasticities produced by themselves and their equally uncivilized competitors.</p><br><br><p>You may not, perhaps, realize that your magazine (which I have been reading for years) is no mere slick and frivolous publication for affluent-gluttons. You have been performing the almost religious and spiritual task of teaching people how to reverence food and drink, and thereby to arouse the rather scarce virtue of conviviality. I am thinking of the true <i>holy communion</i> of sitting around a scrubbed wooden table in a big kitchen with Louis Martini&#x2019;s incredible 39-year-old Tawny Port, the hard Monterey Jack cheese of California, and San Francisco&#x2019;s extra sour French bread&#x2015;with strings of onions and garlic and bottles of chianti hanging from the beams.</p><br><br><p>I therefore urge upon you most strongly to give your readers more information about the actual raising and growing of foodstuffs: how to test out what is offered in the markets, where to go for high quality materials and even how to raise your own. You give wonderful advice about cooking but the whole process depends ultimately on the farming.</p></p><h2>Astrology &amp; Past Lives</h2><p>Astrology &amp; Past Lives is the first book to examine birth charts for previous incarnations.

As other nineteenth-century figures fade, Darwin's theory of evolution still provokes controversy, spilling over into curriculum battles at state and local school boards in the United States and around the world.<br><br> In exploring the everyday artifacts of Darwin's life, his notebooks, and early manuscripts, Niles Eldredge "a candid, no-punches-pulled interpreter of the core ideas of evolutionary biology" (<em>Science News</em>) provides a rare glimpse into the mind of this highly intuitive, creative scientist. The celebration of Charles Darwin's 200th birthday in 2009 begins in November 2005 with the opening of a major exhibition at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, curated by Eldredge, that will travel across the nation. More than a companion book to the exhibit, <em>Darwin</em> is a rich and inspiring reconstruction of Darwin's life through his writings and discoveries.<br> color throughout, 100 illustrations</p><p>Niles Eldredge is a paleontologist and a curator at the American Museum of Natural History and the author of many books on evolutionary theory.The bicentennial of Darwin's birth in 2009 and the sesquicentennial of the publication of <i>On the Origin of Species</i> will be commemorated by a touring exhibition curated by author Eldredge (<i>Life on Earth</i>), of the American Museum of Natural History, that will give audiences a rare opportunity to see Darwin's personal effects, notebooks and materials that contributed to <i>Origin</i>. This book primarily follows Darwin's progress on his theory in the 20 years between his return from the famous voyage on the <i>Beagle </i>and publication of his paradigm-shattering book. Darwin dismembered some of his notebooks, but scholars have reconstructed most of them so that readers can follow his thought processes. Eldredge shows how Darwin laid aside some ideas, like the importance of stasis (which Eldredge and the late Stephen Jay Gould developed into their concept of "punctuated equilibria"), that are now accepted in evolutionary theory. He makes the interesting observation that Darwin was one of the first scientists to abandon Baconian induction in forming hypotheses, consciously turning to the hypothetico-deductive method. Eldredge addresses advances in evolutionary theory since Darwin and takes on intelligent design. The author conveys his great admiration for his subject in a straightforward manner that will enlighten dedicated science readers. 100 illus. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It shows how a leading American psychiatrist of the early twentieth century came to believe that mental illnesses were the product of chronic infections that poisoned the brain. Convinced that he had uncovered the single source of psychosis, Henry Cotton, superintendent of the Trenton State Hospital, New Jersey, launched a ruthless campaign to &#x201c;eliminate the perils of pus infection.&#x201d; Teeth were pulled, tonsils excised, and stomachs, spleens, colons, and uteruses were all sacrificed in the assault on &#x201c;focal sepsis.&#x201d; Many patients did not survive Cotton&#x2019;s surgeries; thousands more were left mangled and maimed. Cotton&#x2019;s work was controversial, yet none of his colleagues questioned his experimental practices. Subsequent historians and psychiatrists too have ignored the events that cast doubt on their favorite narratives of scientific and humanitarian progress. In a remarkable feat of historical detective work, Andrew Scull exposes the full, frightening story of madness among the mad-doctors. Drawing on a wealth of documents and interviews, he reconstructs in vivid detail a nightmarish, cautionary chapter in modern psychiatry when professionals failed to police themselves.</p></p><p><p><i>Madhouse</i> reveals a long-suppressed medical scandal, uncovering the full story of Henry Cotton, the prominent early-twentieth-century American psychiatrist whose ruthless surgical procedures killed or maimed thousands of patients.

Despite these difficulties, Poe produced many works now considered essential to the American literary canon.</p><p><b>Daniel Stashower</b><b></b>is a member of the Baker Street Irregulars and is the author of <i>Teller of Tales: The Life of Arthur Conan Doyle&nbsp;</i>and <i>The Beautiful Cigar Girl: Mary Rogers, Edgar Allen Poe, and the Invention of Murder</i>. He is also a co-editor of several other books about Sherlock Holmes and his creator, including <i>Arthur Conan Doyle: A Life in Letters</i>.</p><b>From Benjamin F. Fisher&#x2019;s Introduction to <i>Essential Tales and Poems by Edgar Allan Poe</i></b> <p></p><p>Poe&#x2019;s tales continue to be the most admired part of his literary legacy, however much he wished to be a poet. One may legitimately ask what were his reasons for resorting to prose fiction as a mainstay, most notably to the short story or, as he preferred, the "tale"? The answer is simple: money. Poe received no profits from his early poems, so he turned to a form that was likely to sell better, the short story, and specifically to short fiction in the Gothic vein. Tales featuring a single character (or at least one who stood out from any others), beset by oppressive and mysterious forces, often amid fantastic settings, existed long before Poe found in this paradigm a suitable creative medium. Terror tales had become staples in periodicals, chiefly in a renowned literary magazine in the Anglo-American literary world during the 1820s, 1830s, and 1840s, the house organ for the well-established Scottish publishing firm of Blackwood: <i>Blackwood&#x2019;s Edinburgh Magazine</i>, colloquially called <i>Blackwood&#x2019;s</i> or <i>Blackwood</i>. It is evident from his writings that Poe&#x2019;s knowledge of this periodical was extensive. His satiric tale "How to Write a Blackwood Article" and its sequel, "A Predicament," lampoon not just recurrent themes, motifs, and stylistic techniques of stories from <i>Blackwood&#x2019;s</i>, but indeed ridicule Poe&#x2019;s own hallmark methods and themes in fiction. Compelling satire and parody require expert comprehension of what one wishes to treat comically, and so we might examine Poe&#x2019;s own fiction to discover what he understood of the production of intriguing Gothic tales.</p><p>Apparently, from the time he left West Point in 1831 for his grandmother Poe&#x2019;s home in Baltimore, until his name appeared in connection with a literary contest in that city late in 1833, he thoughtfully considered what should constitute effective tales of terror. He gave himself an independent study course in content and methodology in popular Gothic fiction as groundwork for his own. He submitted five tales to a prize contest sponsored by a Philadelphia newspaper, the <i>Saturday Courier</i>, near the end of 1831. Although none won the prize, they all circulated in the paper, perhaps without Poe&#x2019;s consent or knowledge, during 1832. The first to appear, "Metzengerstein," seems all too customarily horrific in its "German" setting and its feuding families, connected by supernatural occurrences, who suffer stupendous catastrophes. Horror is evident in young Frederick Metzengerstein&#x2019;s lips, lacerated in fright during his sensational final journey mounted on a giant supernatural horse, an ominous, repulsive creature. This tale may devolve from the folk motif of the devil riding a giant black horse to claim his victims. Poe alters the traditional black coloring of the horse to fiery shades. The other <i>Courier</i> tales were spoofs on what were then best-selling fictions and their authors, and one was not even Gothic.</p><p>In 1833 the Baltimore <i>Saturday Visiter</i>, a weekly newspaper, sponsored a competition with cash prizes for the best poem and tale. Poe&#x2019;s tale "MS. Found in a Bottle" and his poem "The Coliseum" were ranked the winners until the evaluators discovered that both were written by the same person. They decided that the poetry prize would go elsewhere, although Poe asked that they give the other writer the money for the poem but announce that both of his own works had originally been named first&#x2019;s. Poe&#x2019;s wish was ignored, the poetry prize going to "Song of the Winds," by John Hill Hewitt, editor of the <i>Visiter</i>, leaving Poe outraged. The prize selections appeared on October 19, 1833, and Poe&#x2019;s poem on October 26. Those publications, which were reprinted elsewhere in the United States, brought the young writer his first literary recognition. </p><p>Looming, too, was another experimental venture of Poe&#x2019;s, generally known as "Tales of the Folio Club," a book of interlocking frame narratives.4 In this scheme, never actualized, a group of writers, the Folio Club, meet monthly for literary reading and critiques. Preceding the readings are substantial suppers accompanied by plenty of alcohol. After each member reads his original "brief prose tale" (a hit at some best-selling author&#x2019;s typical theme and form), critiques follow. Poe once wrote that these critical interchanges were meant to enliven comedy in the project: Voiced by pretentious would-be authors, each tale is delivered by a first-person narrator, a caricature of an actual popular author represented. Because the author-reader of the worst tale hosts the next meeting, and because one of the group has his works successively targeted, in Poe&#x2019;s scheme, someone in the group eventually becomes enraged, flees to a publisher with the manuscripts, and hurries them into print as an expos�, for revenge.</p><p>What doubtless enlivened the overall scheme was that the club members, from the effects of either eating or/and drinking too much, would have articulated corresponding bizarre situations and repetitious language patterns within their tales, imparting zesty humor to those fictions, such mirth given point by the critiques. Had "Tales of the Folio Club" been published, a far different conception of Poe might have emerged early in his career&#x2014;with what future we may only conjecture. Publishers rejected his manuscript, however, on grounds that the content was far too sophisticated for average readers and sales would not warrant the financial risk. Poe eventually dismantled the collection, brought out individual stories in periodicals, and thereby paved the way for readers&#x2019; disagreements that continue to be dynamic even today.</p></p><h2>Pat F. Garrett&#39;s the Authentic Life of Billy the Kid</h2><p><p>More than twelve decades after Billy the Kid�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s death in 1881, books, movies, and essays about this western outlaw are still popular. And they all go back to one source: <i>The Authentic Life of Billy, the Kid</i>, published in 1882 by the man who killed Billy, Sheriff Pat Garrett.</p><p>Frederick Nolan, an authority on the American Southwest, examines the legends introduced by <i>The Authentic Life</i> and shows how Garrett�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s book is responsible for misconceptions about the Kid�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s early life and his short, violent career. This edition, complete with the original text, corrects errors, amplifies Garrett�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s narrative, and elucidates the causes and course of the Lincoln County War in New Mexico during the 1870s. Nolan provides an introduction that reappraises the last, fatal meeting of Garrett and Billy the Kid, as well as a postscript about the sheriff�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s snakebitten life following the moment that made him famous.</p></p><p><p><strong>Pat F. Garrett,</strong> the Southwest's most celebrated sheriff, is best known for his killing of Billy the Kid and for this book, which was written in collaboration with his friend, frontier newspaperman Ashmun Upson.</p> <br> <br> <p><b>Frederick Nolan</b> is a leading authority on outlaws and gunfighters of the Old West. His award-winning books include <i>The West of Billy the Kid</i>;<i> The Wild West: History, Myth, and the Making of America</i>; and <i>The Lincoln County War: A Documentary History</i>. He resides in England.</p>Few figures are as associated with the Wild West as Billy, the Kid. As with many of those frontier figures, the myths, often created by pennydreadfuls and B movies, have overshadowed the truth. Sheriff Garrett was both Billy's friend and the man who eventually sent him to the last roundup. With the help of ghostwriter Ash Upton, Garrett published what he called the Kid's Authentic story in 1882. This annotated edition, however, shows that it wasn't quite so authentic after all, and here, Western historian Frederick Nolan includes notes and commentary correcting falsehoods written by Upton along with 19 period photos. Was Billy a true Western hero fighting for justice in New Mexico's Lincoln County War or simply a wacko who enjoyed killing?

In dozens of stories, anecdotes, and case histories, they show how family members all use money in covert ways that express desires, struggles for power, and yearning for commitment. To prevent money issues from destroying relationships, the authors present an extraordinary problem-solving technique that uses money to restore and heal family relationships.</p><p>An underlying theme in literature--from timeless classics to long-forgotten potboilers--and in much of today's popular biography and mass-market family drama is the power of money to manipulate, seduce, control, or corrupt others. But barely an armful of books have been written that explicitly discuss the psychological aspects of money and its effect on relationships. Clo{&#x201a;}e Madanes, who directs the Family Therapy Institute in Washington, D.C., and wrote <i>Strategic Family Therapy</i> (1981), utilizes anecdote and observation to demonstrate how money and the way it is used can be either the cause or the symptom of problems in interpersonal relationships. She focuses on relations between parent and child, young couples, divorced couples, and siblings. She also contrasts how the role of money in relationships changes from youth to middle age to older years and distinguishes between problems of wealth and those of poverty. Finally, Madanes suggests guidelines for using money effectively that she says will improve relationships. <i>David Rouse</i></p><h2>Interpreting Engineering Drawings</h2><p>Designed to provide a complete and customized learning experience for each reader, this edition of our popular Interpreting Engineering Drawings book now features expanded units on &#34;Drawings for Numerical Control&#34; and &#34;Manufacturing Materials.&#34; The first section acquaints readers with topics that are universally applicable to the interpretation of all mechanical/industrial drawings, such as: drawing standards, abbreviations, basic rules for dimensioning, reading and measuring with US inch and SI metric scales, plus different types of sectional views.

It&#x2019;s a cookie-cutter, fear-based, top-down approach that emphasizes negatives over positives and stifles healthy career conversations. It&#x2019;s never been shown to motivate anyone to do anything but try to avoid it, but nobody feels like they have any alternative. Tamra Chandler has one&#x2014;and it works. <br><br> Actually, Chandler doesn't offer a single alternative&#x2014;she offers an infinite number of them. Each organization that uses her Performance Management Reboot is able to develop its own unique version since it doesn&#x2019;t make a lot of sense for organizations with different cultures, in different industries and sectors, to do things exactly the same way. Grounded in the latest scientific findings about motivation, it&#x2019;s a transparent, employee-driven process that values collaboration over competition and rewards people for acquiring new skills and increasing their contribution instead of hitting arbitrary benchmarks. <br><br> Chandler lays out the general principles and then walks you through each step in creating a performance management process that employees will actually embrace rather than avoid and that will help you meet the three objectives of great performance management: developing your people, rewarding them equitably, and driving your organization&#x2019;s performance. It&#x2019;s the first comprehensive, step-by-step guide to creating a performance management solution that&#x2019;s tailored to your organization&#x2019;s needs and goals and that places the emphasis squarely on your greatest asset: your people.</p><p>Performance reviews don&#39;t work--they demotivate and drag performance.

Paul R. McHugh and Phillip R. Slavney offer an approach that emphasizes psychiatry's unifying concepts while accommodating its diversity. Recognizing that there may never be a single, all-encompassing theory, the book distills psychiatric practice into four explanatory methods: diseases, dimensions of personality, goal-directed behaviors, and life stories. These perspectives, argue the authors, underlie the principles and practice of all psychiatry.

A founder member of the Dada group, he was also associated with Surrealism and with Concrete Art and Minimalism. Such acclaim has overshadowed the fact that he considered himself above all a poet. This book, the first major English-language study of Arp in nearly half a century, is also the first to reveal that Arp&#x2019;s practices as poet, painter, and sculptor are not only complementary but mutually dependent facets of a coherent aesthetic strategy.<br>Eric Robertson discusses Arp&#x2019;s lifelong practice of moving freely between his different expressive forms and his two languages (French and German), and his tendency to alter his earlier works. Examining major works in the light of recent critical and theoretical perspectives, the book addresses key questions relating to Arp&#x2019;s practices and reappraises his relationship to the avant-garde as well as his standing in art-historical and literary contexts.</p><p><b>Eric Robertson</b> is&nbsp;Professor of Modern French Literary and Visual&nbsp;Culture&nbsp;at Royal Holloway, University of London.</p><h2>The Vixen Manual: How to Find, Seduce &amp; Keep the Man You Want</h2><p>Since she exploded on the scene with her two juicy and impossible-to-put-down tell-alls, readers have wanted to know even more about what makes Karrine Steffans tick.

The most in-depth and authoritative history of the subject available, <i>The History of American Higher Education</i> traces how colleges and universities were shaped by the shifting influences of culture, the emergence of new career opportunities, and the unrelenting advancement of knowledge.</p><p>Roger Geiger, arguably today's leading historian of American higher education, vividly describes how colonial colleges developed a unified yet diverse educational tradition capable of weathering the social upheaval of the Revolution as well as the evangelical fervor of the Second Great Awakening. He shows how the character of college education in different regions diverged significantly in the years leading up to the Civil War&#x2015;for example, the state universities of the antebellum South were dominated by the sons of planters and their culture&#x2015;and how higher education was later revolutionized by the land-grant movement, the growth of academic professionalism, and the transformation of campus life by students. By the beginning of the Second World War, the standard American university had taken shape, setting the stage for the postwar education boom.</p><p>Breathtaking in scope and rich in narrative detail, <i>The History of American Higher Education</i> is the most comprehensive single-volume history of the origins and development of of higher education in the United States.</p></p><p><p>"The thoroughness, judiciousness, and clarity of this book make it the gold standard on the subject.

While U.S. interest has long been sporadic and reactive, 9/11 alerted Washington that paying only fitful attention to one of the world's most volatile and populous regions was a recipe for everyday instability, repeated international crises, major and minor wars, and conditions so chronically unsettled that they continue to provide a fertile breeding ground for transnational Islamic terrorism. Exploring the many facets of this dynamic region, the book also assesses U.S. policy toward Afghanistan and explains the importance of Bangladesh and Pakistan, two of only a handful of Islamic states with significant track records as democracies.</p><p><b>Devin T.

Cohen, The Brookings Institution)</p><h2>Irony on Occasion: From Schlegel and Kierkegaard to Derrida and de Man</h2><p><p>What is it about irony&#x2015;as an object of serious philosophical reflection and a literary technique of considerable elasticity&#x2015;that makes it an occasion for endless critical debate? This book responds to this question by focusing on several key moments in German Romanticism and its afterlife in twentieth-century French thought and writing. It includes chapters on Friedrich Schlegel, S�ren Kierkegaard, Friedrich Nietzsche, Thomas Mann, Jean Paulhan, Maurice Blanchot, Jacques Derrida, and Paul de Man. A coda traces the way unresolved tensions inherited from Romanticism resurface in a novelist like J. M. Coetzee. </p><p>But this book is neither a historical nor a thematic study of irony. To the degree that irony initiates a deflection of meaning, it also entails a divergence from historical and thematic models of understanding. The book therefore aims to respect irony's digressive force by allowing it to emerge from questions that sometimes have little or nothing to do with the ostensible topic of irony. For if irony is the possibility that whatever is being said does not coincide fully with whatever is being meant, then there is no guarantee that the most legitimate approach to the problem would proceed directly to those places where "irony" is named, described, or presumed to reside. </p><p>Rather than providing a history of irony, then, this book examines particular occasions of ironic disruption. It thus offers an alternative model for conceiving of historical occurrences and their potential for acquiring meaning.</p></p><p>Kevin Newmark teaches literature and literary theory at Boston College.

Do matter, time and space change, or do they remain constant everywhere in the universe? Is there always a relationship between cause and effect, or do some things &#34;just happen?&#34; Many of our basic ideas about the world have been shaped by science--but seldom are such discoveries accepted easily or willingly. Here are seven of the most important ideas in physics--ideas that shattered the assumptions of dogmatists, philosophers and scientists--explained simply and elegantly. And you don&#39;t need a background in mathematics or science to enjoy this fascinating book. Seven Ideas That Shook the Universe explores the history of seven important themes in physics: Copernican astronomy, Newtonian mechanics, energy and entropy, relativity, quantum theory, and conservation principles and symmetries. Together these discoveries form the foundation of our understanding of the physical world. Nathan Spielberg and Bryon Anderson explain each concept in a simple, straightforward narrative style, considering each in the context of its times and assessing its impact on the way we think about time, space, matter, even existence itself.

Friedman, a friend of Pollock&#39;s and active in the art world, shows him to be a brilliant man tormented by his relationship to his family; an artist who worked hard through years of poverty to achieve his controversial painting technique; the first American painter to gain an international reputation for himself and for what has been variously called Action Painting or Abstract Expressionism; and a man who struggled with alcohol and the tension between gentleness and violence.Newly illustrated with seminal Pollock paintings, this book takes the reader inside the art world of New York during the &#39;40s and &#39;50s, when Action Painting first emerged. Friedman reveals what it meant to Pollock to experience the invasion of his studio and of the very act of painting by the external pressures of shows, reviews, films, dealers, critics, hostile publicity; and how, despite it all, Pollock created many of the most graceful and powerful paintings ever made in America.</p><p>Newly illustrated with seminal Pollock paintings, this book takes the reader inside the art world of New York during the &#39;40s and &#39;50s, when Action Painting first emerged.Novelist, biographer, playwright, and art critic, <b>B.

In this field guide, a sequel to the volume on Papilionidae, Pieridae, and Nymphalidae, Philip DeVries provides the first detailed treatment of over 250 species of Costa Rican butterflies in the family Riodinidae. Drawing from his extensive fieldwork, museum research, and surveys of scientific literature, DeVries presents the means to identify riodinid butterflies to the species level and gives an overview of their natural history. This guide illustrates nearly all of the Costa Rican species in color and provides a large sample of detailed line drawings and scanning electron micrographs of riodinid early stages for the first time ever. The book's coverage makes it useful for identifying riodinids throughout Mexico, Central America, and substantial portions of South America.</p><br><p>The introductory chapter brings together a large body of material that applies directly to understanding riodinid butterflies in general. The taxonomy, distribution, and natural history of each taxon is discussed in detail. The author also provides sections on ecology, evolution, behavior, symbioses with ants, caterpillar acoustical calls, systematics, collecting and preserving, hostplant relationships, and the comparative diversity of riodinid butterfly faunas. A section on butterfly biologists of the last century provides a historical perspective to the basis of our understanding of Neotropical butterflies.</p></p><p>&#34;A massive storehouse of superb natural history.

The curriculum builds on itself through the grades, adding new skills, concepts, and abilities year after year. As she writes in the Introduction:</p> <p>&#x201c;We are facing an environmental crisis. Crisis is good because it brings us to consciousness.... What we give time to becomes important. Having a regular time of the day when children work with and experience nature represents a path out of this crisis. To have a lasting impact, ecological principles must be woven into all aspects of education as experiences as well as concepts. Big or small, urban or rural, a space for a garden can lead children back to the natural world. If we want our children to have access to the many resources in nature, we must educate them to love and preserve these resources. This is the first step in building a heart-felt relationship to nature and growing &#x2018;sustainable children.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p></p><p><b>Ronni Sands<i> </i></b>has been a Waldorf Garden Teacher at Summerfield Waldorf School and Farm near Santa Rosa, California for more than twenty years.

Together in one volume, these thematically linked short novels display Wharton&#x2019;s characteristic criticism of society&#x2019;s hypocrisy, and her daring exploration of the destructive consequences of sexual appetite. From the wintry setting of <i>Ethan Frome</i>, where a man hounded by community standards is destroyed by the very thing that might bring him happiness, to the florid town of <i>Summer</i>, where a young woman&#x2019;s first romance projects her into a dizzying rite of passage, Wharton captures beautifully the urges and failures of human nature.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Praise for Edith Wharton and <i>Ethan Frome</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;<i>Ethan Frome</i> [is considered] Mrs. Wharton&#x2019;s masterpiece . . .

Within this discussion a host of correlations emerge, crossing social, cultural, historical, political, and racial spheres. In order to anchor their discussion Borisoff and Chesebro define the terms gender, power, and communication, which provides an operational platform from which to view fundamental issues such as the effects of stereotyping and verbal and nonverbal communication by gender. The authors also consider four contexts that shape and influence gender socialization and sex-role constructions: mediated communication and gender roles in various media systems, early socialization in the home, the educational landscape, and women and men in the workplace.<p> Our environment continually generates new kinds of questions and associations. The more we interact with others the more we realize that our relationships are not fixed they exist in a state of flux. <i>Communicating Power and Gender</i> explores not only how gender-based issues affect us daily, but also how gender-based communication can be more sensitively, usefully, and effectively employed.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Duties of the Heart</h2><p>The Duties of the Heart (Chovos Halevovos) is Rabbi Bachya ibn Pakuda's classic theological work on the Jewish principles of faith and man's inner relationship to himself and to God.<br>By outlining and defining ten indispensable principles of faith and by guiding the reader toward devout adherence to these principles, Ibn Pakuda teaches each and every Jew the way to perfect his or herself and, in this way, to draw closer to God.<br>Bachya ibn Pakuda defines the following principles, expounds upon their significance, and reveals how to foster and practice them: the Wholehearted Acceptance of God's Oneness, Reflection, Service to God, Trust in God, Dedicating Our Actions, Surrender, Repentance, Introspection, Abstinence, and the Complete Love of God. Ibn Pakuda also warns the reader about what to avoid so as not to falter on the path to perfection.<br>The Duties of the Heart also provides the reader with a broad treatment of certain existential issues, including the nature of the soul, reward and punishment, Divine Providence, and free will. Ibn Pakuda offers proof of God's existence, addresses the Jew's place in the great multitudinousness of the universe, confronts power and subservience, explores the restoration of true health and vitality, and reveals the primal oscillation of the soul alternately toward and away from God.<br>Perhaps the most fundamental issue addressed in The Duties of the Heart is the nature of our inner selves and our inner relationship to God. Until the nineteenth century and the advent of modern psychology in the Western world, it was widely believed that all our motivations were conscious and rational. But the theory of an unconscious mind, only brought to the fore by Sigmund Freud and his contemporaries, was in fact the foundation for eleventh-century Ibn Pakuda's belief in the relationship between the soul of man and the World to Come.<br>Yaakov Feldman renders a lucid and contemporary translation of the classic eleventh-century work The Duties of the Heart, making it accessible for the first time to the modern reader who seeks to incorporate meaning, discipline, and spirituality into his or her way of life.<br>The reader may conclude, after studying Ibn Pakuda's work, that God's presence is within each and every Jew and, hence, even closer and more approachable to him or her than someone who is as emotionally and personally close as possible, yet remains a separate, physical entity. By delving into his or her inner self, the reader will discover God's presence in his or her life and enjoy the fruits of revelation and truth.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Hebrew</p><h2>The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Quotations</h2><p>This newly expanded edition of the acclaimed <em>Oxford Dictionary of Literary Quotations</em> illuminates the world of the writer, from Shakespeare to Stephen King, from the quill to the PC.

Its straightforward style, streamlined design, and highly focused coverage make it the perfect affordable, ultra brief, introductory text for instructors who use a variety of materials in their course. The new fourth edition includes new chapter opening vignettes and up to date coverage of current topics such as the Virginia Tech shooting and the use of virtual networks such as Facebook.</p><p>Growing up in Chicago at a time when neighborhoods were going through transitions in ethnic and racial composition, Richard T. Schaefer found himself increasingly intrigued by what was happening, how people were reacting, and how these changes were affecting neighborhoods and people&#x2019;s jobs. His interest in social issues caused him to gravitate to sociology courses at Northwestern University, where he received a B.A. in Sociology. "Originally as an undergraduate I thought I would go on to law school and become a lawyer. But after taking a few sociology courses, I found myself wanting to learn more about what sociologists studied and fascinated by the kinds of questions they raised." This fascination led him to obtain his M.A. and Ph.D. in Sociology from the University of Chicago. Dr. Schaefer&#x2019;s continuing interest in race relations led him to write his masters&#x2019; thesis on the membership of the Ku Klux Klan and his doctoral thesis on racial prejudice and race relations in Great Britain. Dr. Schaefer went on to become a professor of sociology. He has taught introductory sociology for 30 years to students in colleges, adult education programs, nursing programs, and even a maximum-security prison. Dr. Schaefer&#x2019;s love of teaching is apparent in his interaction with his students. "I find myself constantly learning from the students who are in my classes and from reading what they write. Their insights into the material we read or current events that we discuss often become part of future course material and sometimes even find their way into my writing." Dr. Schaefer is author of the third edition of Sociology: A Brief Introduction (McGraw-Hill, 2000). Dr. Schaefer is also the author of Racial and Ethnic Groups now in its eighth edition, and Race and Ethnicity in the United States, second edition. His articles and book reviews have appeared in many journals, including American Journal of Sociology, Phylon: A Review of Race and Culture, Contemporary Sociology, Sociology and Social Research, Sociological Quarterly, and Teaching Sociology. He served as president of the Midwest Sociological Society in 1994-1995. Dr. Schaefer&#x2019;s advice to students is to "look at the material and make connections to your own life and experiences. Sociology will make you a more attentive observer of how people in groups interact and function. It will also make you more aware of peoples&#x2019; different needs and interests &#x2014; and perhaps more ready to work for the common good, while still recognizing the individuality of each person."</p><h2>Disarming the Playground: Violence Prevention Through Movement &amp; Pro-Social Skills</h2><p>"Since violent acts are a series of movements our bodies have learned to use to represent our inability to control emotions like anger; it follows that learning different movements to express or react to anger can prevent violence."--<i>Disarming the Playground</i><br> <br>Anger and violence in school and at home destroys trust and relationships. <i>Disarming the Playground</i> provides a movement-based curriculum of activities that promote non-violence and anger management in hopes of removing this unnecessary detriment to child development and welfare.<br> <br>Based on the idea that physical action can healthily expresses emotion without harming others, the author encourages body-awareness and a deeper understanding of internal physical sensations, as well as social skills for coping with and diffusing violent situations. The activities included easily adapt to differing ages and developmental stages appropriate for pre-school through middle school. Lesson plans, step-by-step directions, discussion topics, and suggested props avail the curriculum to use by teachers and parents alike.</p><p>no publishers comments for this book, please deleteRena Kornblum currently teaches at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Four in particular are studied. The authors of the Letter of Aristeas and the Sibylline Oracles came from second-century BC Egypt. Eupolemus wrote probably in Jerusalem at the same time. Josephus, a priest from Judaea, wrote in Rome in the late first century AD. Using Greek, not Hebrew or Aramaic, and conscious of the position of Jews in the Graeco-Roman world, they wished to demonstrate that their cultural and religious heritage stood comparison with the Graeco-Roman tradition and that Jews were neither so philosophically naive nor so politically troublesome as they were often supposed to be. An opening chapter describing the position of Jews in the Hellenistic world is followed by selected passages, all newly translated, with introductory essays and commentary. The collection makes available to students much material hitherto not easily accessible.</p><p>This book aims to introduce the work of Hellenistic Jewish writers of the period 200 BC to AD 200.

In farfetched allusions to problems overcome by Sitting Bull, the authors urge politicians, CEOs and public services chiefs to emulate the Sioux leader's qualities--commitment, integrity, courage, statesmanship and vision--qualities successfully employed by executives of the few firms cited here. Murphy and Snell propose three phases of action divided into 13 steps: to restore the nation's confidence, to mobilize its resources and to develop Sitting Bull-like leadership.

Yet, until now, there has been no comprehensive treatment of how Germany and Austria-Hungary - two of the key belligerents - conducted the war and what defeat meant to them. Much of the writing on the war has hallowed the tactical and operational effectiveness of the German army. Yet Germany lost the conflict. In tackling this paradox, Herwig shows how greatly the Central Powers suffered from inadequate resources and an incapacity to manage effectively what they had. He also shows with clarity just how much of Germany&#39;s effort was expended in sustaining not only its own war effort but also that of its ally, without any corresponding subordination of Vienna to Berlin, as the economic and military realities required. But it is in his reassessment of Germany&#39;s military effectiveness that he offers the most fundamental corrective. For readers accustomed to criticisms of the various Allied commanders, Herwig&#39;s examination of the German military effort will have uncanny echoes. Even the famous German offensives of March 1918, regarded as a model of breakthrough operations by interwar theorists, are condemned not just for their lack of strategic objective but even for their tactical failings.</p><h2>Great Source Math to Know: A Mathematics Handbook, Grades 3-4</h2><p>The only math resource you'll need for school or home, Math to Know has everything you need for math success.<br><br>Math to Know also includes a handy Almanac with math prefixes and suffixes, study tips, test-taking strategies, guidelines for using calculators and other math tools, helpful lists and tables, and more.</p><p>&#34;This is the first handbook (including textbooks) that simplifies the material/facts all in one book.

Here are remedies for ridding lawns, gardens, and trees of destructive invaders.</p><p>If you have a home, an apartment, a garden, or a pet (or, in some cases, housemates or tenants), you&#39;ve probably got pests. And if you want to control pests, there&#39;s no need to poison yourself. While the Green Revolution and DDT and other pesticides dominated the world of agribusiness, thoughtful scientists world-wide were simultanously and silently working on &#34;Integrated Pest Management&#34;, which is often as effective as pesticides at reducing or eliminating pests. From ridding your apartment of cockroaches to dealing with the regional deforestation threats of Gypsy Moths, this is the authoritative book on how to control pests by using the natural mechanisms of control that have kept our planet from being savaged, prior to our human disruptions.<p>Dr. William Olkowski, Sheila Daar, and Helga Olkowski each have over 40 years&#x2019; experience designing least-toxic management programs against invertebrate, microbial and vertebrate pests, in a wide range of urban and rural settings.

The result of this unique collaboration is a lively conversation that not only demonstrates what is most fundamental to each discipline, but creates a joint perspective on reading literature that neither discipline alone can achieve. <p>This book radically redefines the relationship between psychoanalysis and literary studies in a way that revitalizes the conversation between the two fields. This is achieved, in part, by providing richly textured descriptions of analytic work. These clinical illustrations bring to life the intersubjective dimension of analytic practice, which is integral to the book&#x2019;s original conception of psychoanalytic literary criticism. In their readings of seminal works of American and European literature, the authors address questions that are fundamental to psychoanalysis, literary studies, and the future of psychoanalytic literary criticism:</p> <p>-What is psychoanalytic literary criticism?</p> <p>-Which concepts are most fundamental to psychoanalytic theory?</p> <p>-What is the role of psychoanalytic theory in reading literature?</p> <p>-How does an analyst&#x2019;s clinical experience shape the way he reads? </p> <p>-How might literary critics make use of the analyst&#x2019;s experience with his patients?</p> <p>-What might psychoanalysts learn from the ways professional literary critics read? </p> <p>This volume provides cutting edge work which will breathe new life into psychoanalytic ways of reading, free from technical language, yet drawing upon what is most fundamental to psychoanalytic theory and practice. It will be of great interest to mental health professionals, literary scholars and those studying psychoanalysis and literature.</p></p><p><p><strong>Benjamin H.

William Shakespeare's plays are no exception. His plays tell stories of kings and queens, of ghosts and witches, of romance and passion. But to get to the story at the heart of the plays, the reader must first work through Shakespeare's language, a task often too great for younger readers (and for many adults). Now, in this new edition, E. Nesbit, the classic British children's author, brings ten of Shakespeare's greatest plays to life. She shakes off the burdensome complexity of Shakespeare's language and tells the stories at the core of the plays. Sprinkled with her own dashes of wit and humor, her graceful, vivid retellings, using accessible language, are the perfect introduction to Shakespeare's work.<br> Nesbit's stories are also the perfect way for adults to brush up on the ins and outs of Shakespeare's plays. Who can remember the names of King Lear's three daughters? Was Romeo a Montagu or a Capulet? What, exactly, was Hamlet's problem?<br> All of these major works are included in this collection: <em>Romeo and Juliet,</em> <em>Hamlet,</em> <em>Macbeth,</em> <em>Othello,</em> <em>King Lear,</em> <em>The Merchant of Venice,</em> <em>The Tempest,</em> <em>As You Like It,</em> <em>The Winter's Tale,</em> and <em>Twelfth Night.</em><br> The text is illustrated throughout with dramatic black and white photographs from modern productions of the plays by the Royal Shakespeare Company, the Stratford Festival (Ontario, Canada), and the Folger Library's Shakespeare Theater, bringing the action and characters to life. Also included is an afterword by Peter Hunt, a leading scholar of children's literature.<br> These retellings of the classic tales of one of the world's greatest playwrights remind us that it is never too early for Shakespeare.</p><p>Yes, the name is familiar. E. Nesbit, who died in 1924, gave us <i>The Railway Children</i> and <i>The Enchanted Castle</i>. Now, with the publication of the Shakespeare stories she wrote (at their request) for her own children, adults and kids together can enjoy her fairy-tale prose in the retelling of 10 of Shakespeare's greatest stories. <p> If you aren't sure you remember which daughter Lear visited first, who was traveling with Macbeth when he met those witches, or just why Rosalind was wandering around in the forest dressed like a boy--check here. Wonderful on their own, these retellings are also great preparation for any early theater or film excursion into these timeless plays. </p><p> [The publishers recommend this book for ages 11 to adult, and they're right.]</p><br><strong>E. Nesbit</strong> (1858-1924) is the author of many influential stories and novels for children, including <em>The Wouldbegoods</em> (1901), <em>The Phoenix and the Carpet</em> (1904), <em>The Railway Children</em> (1906), and <em>The Enchanted Castle</em> (1907). Her respect for children helped lay the groundwork for the direction of children's literature in the twentieth century.<br></p><h2>American Foreign Policy: The Dynamics of Choice in the 21st Century</h2><p><p><strong>A crystal-clear, engaging introduction to U.S. foreign policy by one of the leading scholars in the field.</strong></p> Addressing both foreign policy strategy and foreign policy politics, Bruce Jentleson&#x2015;respected scholar, award-winning teacher, and foreign policy practitioner&#x2015;offers students the theoretical framework, historical context, and policy analysis essential for understanding American foreign policy in the twenty-first century.<br><br> Professor Jentleson focuses on foreign policy strategy and foreign policy politics and employs a four-part framework (the four Ps: Power, Peace, Prosperity, and Principles) through which students can begin to appreciate the problems and choices faced by the United States as it tries to steer a course through world events.<br><br> The Fourth Edition of <em>American Foreign Policy</em> has been thoroughly updated with relevant political developments, including foreign policy changes instituted by the Obama administration.</p><p>Bruce W.

The text explores architecture, sculpture, vasepainting, wallpainting, and metalwork, blending factual information with scholarly interpretation and the latest archaeological discoveries. It begins with an Introduction that describes the scope of the book and the history of the retrieval of the monuments and materials of antiquity. Three following chapters cover the Greek Bronze Age, and then seven chapters address the historical periods from 1100 BC to 31 BC.This useful, scholarly, and well-organized text examines Greek art in an archaeological context, organizing artifacts from c.3000 to 30 B.C. both chronologically and by medium. While the writing is occasionally a bit dry, a common problem for texts attempting to cover such a vast subject, it is fairly accessible. Pedley (classical archaeology and Greek, Univ. of Michigan) does not simply rehash material covered in other texts; he includes information gathered from recent archaeological findings. Most of the numerous illustrations are standard black-and-white archival photographs, but the sketches, maps, and plans are particularly well done and very useful for a clear understanding of the objects and areas depicted. The glossary, chronology, index, and bibliography are excellent. For the undergraduate student or independent learner. --Mary Morgan Smith, Northland P.

Distinct from the details of implementation, algorithm, and data representation, an architecture holds the key to achieving system quality, is a reusable asset that can be applied to subsequent systems, and is crucial to a software organization's business strategy. </p> <p>Drawing on their own extensive experience, the authors cover the essential technical topics for designing, specifying, and validating a system. They also emphasize the importance of the business context in which large systems are designed. Their aim is to present software architecture in a real-world setting, reflecting both the opportunities and constraints that companies encounter. To that end, case studies that describe successful architectures illustrate key points of both technical and organizational discussions. </p> <p>Topics new to this edition include:</p> <ul> <li>Architecture design and analysis, including the Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM) </li> <li>Capturing quality requirements and achieving them through quality scenarios and tactics </li> <li>Using architecture reconstruction to recover undocumented architectures </li> <li>Documenting architectures using the Unified Modeling Language (UML)</li> <li>New case studies, including Web-based examples and a wireless Enterprise JavaBeans&#x2122; (EJB) system designed to support wearable computers</li> <li>The financial aspects of architectures, including use of the Cost Benefit Analysis Method (CBAM) to make decisions </li> </ul> <p>If you design, develop, or manage the building of large software systems (or plan to do so), or if you are interested in acquiring such systems for your corporation or government agency, use <i> <b>Software Architecture in Practice, Second Edition,</b> </i> to get up to speed on the current state of software architecture.</p></p><p><p> <b>Len Bass</b> is a senior member of the technical staff at the Software Engineering Institute (SEI).

Nevertheless, to our knowledge, there exists little practical guidance on managing software architecture in a real software development organization, from both technical and managerial perspectives. This book has emerged from our belief that the coupling of a system's software architecture and its business and organizational context has not been well explored. </p> <p>Our experience with designing and analyzing large and complex software-intensive systems has led us to recognize the role of business and organization in the design of the system and in its ultimate success or failure. Systems are built to satisfy an organization's requirements (or assumed requirements in the case of shrink-wrapped products). These requirements dictate the system's performance, availability, security, compatibility with other systems, and the ability to accommodate change over its lifetime. The desire to satisfy these goals with software that has the requisite properties influences the design choices made by a software architect.</p> <p>In this book we demonstrate this coupling of software architecture and corporate context through the use of case studies drawn from real systems. Our examples include the following situations:</p> <li>The desire to share documents quickly and easily within an organization, with a minimum of centralized control, led to the software architecture of the World Wide Web. </li> <li>The extreme safety requirements of air traffic control led one company to build a system around an architecture for achieving ultra-high availability.</li> <li>The distribution of the subsystems of a flight simulator to remotely located developers led to an architecture geared to enable smooth integration of these subsystems.</li> <li>The need to satisfy simultaneous product deliveries led (in fact, forced) one company to adopt an architecture that enabled the company to build a set of complex related software systems as a product line.</li> <li>The need to standardize architectural approaches across organizations and in the community at large led to infrastructures such as J2EE and EJB.</li> <p>These and other case studies show that software architectures flow from the requirements of organizations and their business models, from the experience of the organization's architects, as well as from the prevailing design climate. </p> <p>In addition, we show how architectures themselves can be powerful vehicles for influencing all of the preceding. A successful product or set of products can influence the way other products are built. Certainly the case study about the software underlying the World Wide Web is a good example of this. Before this system existed, there was far less network awareness, less thought was given to accessibility of data, and security was the concern of only a few organizations, typically financial institutions and government agencies. </p> <p>Our book is aimed at software professionals--the people who design and implement large software-intensive systems, the managers of software professionals, and the students who are hoping to become software professionals.</p> <p>We believe that a software architecture is the development product that gives the highest return on investment with respect to quality, schedule, and cost. Because its architecture appears early in a product's lifetime, getting it right sets the stage for everything to come--the system's development, integration, testing, and modification. Getting it wrong means that the fabric of the system is wrong, and it cannot be fixed by weaving in a few new threads or pulling out a few existing ones, which often causes the entire fabric to unravel. Also, compared to other development activities, analyzing architectures is inexpensive. Thus, architectures give a high return on investment because decisions made for the architecture have substantial downstream consequences and because checking and fixing an architecture is relatively inexpensive.</p> <p>We also believe that re-use is achieved best within an architectural context. But components are not the only artifacts that can be re-used. Re-use of an architecture leads to the creation of families of systems, which in turn leads to new organizational structures and new business opportunities.</p> <p>We devote a large percentage of this book to presenting real architectures that were designed to solve the real problems of real organizations. We chose the cases presented here to illuminate the types of choices that architects must make to achieve their quality goals and to illuminate how organizational goals affect the final systems. </p> <p>In addition to the case studies, this book offers a set of techniques for designing, building, and evaluating software architectures. We look at techniques for understanding quality requirements in the context of an architecture, and for building architectures that meet these quality requirements. We look at architecture representation and reconstruction techniques as a means of describing and validating software architectures. We look at techniques for analyzing and evaluating an architecture's fitness for its purpose. Each of these techniques is derived from our experience, and the experience of our colleagues at the Software Engineering Institute, with a variety of software systems. These systems range up to millions of lines of code and are large-team, multi-year development efforts.</p> <p>Although we discuss business issues throughout the book (for example, an architecture's effects on an organization's ability to compete in a market or a product family's time-to-market), we present this material without going into great depth on the business issues, and without business jargon. We are, after all, software engineers. We present the technical sections of our book in more depth. These sections represent current work in the field of software architecture--the point where research meets practice. The case studies illuminate these technical foundations, and show how they are realized in practice. To benefit from the lessons illuminated by the case studies, you will need a reasonable background in computer science, software engineering, or a related discipline. However, we have written them in such a way that you will not need expertise in the application domain from which the case study was drawn. For example, you do need not be a pilot to understand either the air traffic control system or the flight simulation case studies. </p> <p><b>What's New in the Second Edition</b></p> <p>Our goals for this second edition are the same as they were for the first, but the passage of time since the writing of the first edition has brought new developments in the field and new understanding of the important underpinnings of software architecture. We reflect the new developments with new case studies and our new understanding both through new chapters and through strengthening the existing chapters. Also, the writing of this second edition has been strongly influenced by several other books that we have collectively authored since the publication of the first edition--Documenting Software Architectures, Evaluating Software Architectures: Methods and Case Studies, and Software Product Lines: Principles and Practice. The creation of these books, along with other technical and research activities, has greatly influnced us in developing this book. This second edition reflects the fact that architecture analysis, design, reconstruction, and documentation have all had major developments since the first edition.</p> <p>Architecture analysis has developed into a mature field with industrial-strength methods--reflected here by a new chapter in Part Three about the Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAMSM). Many industrial organizations have adopted the ATAM as a technique for evaluating software architectures.</p> <p>Architecture design has also had major developments since the first edition. The capturing of quality requirements, their achievement through small-scale and large-scale architectural approaches (tactics and patterns, respectively), and a design method that reflects knowledge of how to achieve them are all discussed in various chapters. Three new chapters treat understanding quality requirements, achieving qualities, and the Attribute Driven Design Method (ADD). </p> <p>Architecture reconstruction, or reverse engineering, is an essential activity for capturing undocumented architectures. It can be used as a portion of a design project or as an analysis project, or as input into a decision regarding what to use as a basis for reconstructing a system. In the first edition, we briefly mentioned a tool set (Dali) and its uses in the re-engineering context, but in this edition the topic merits its own chapter.</p> <p>Documenting software architectures is another topic that has matured considerably in the recent past. When the first edition was published, the Unified Modeling Language (UML) was just arriving on the scene. Now it is firmly entrenched, a reality reflected here with all-new diagrams. More important, an understanding of the kind of information to capture about an architecture, beyond which notation to use, has emerged. A new chapter covers architecture documentation.</p> <p>The application of software architecture to enable organizations to efficiently produce a variety of systems based on a single architecture is summarized in a totally rewritten chapter on software product lines. This chapter reinforces the link between architecture and an organization's business goals, in view of the fact that product lines (based around a software architecture) can enable order-of-magnitude improvements in cost, quality, and time-to-market. </p> <p>In addition to the architectural developments, the technology for constructing distributed and Web-based systems has become prominent in today's economy. We reflect this trend in our updated chapter on the World Wide Web by using Web-based examples in the chapter on the ATAM and the chapter on building systems from components, by replacing the case study on Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) with one on Enterprise JavaBeans (EJBs), and by introducing a case study on a wireless EJB system designed to support wearable computers for maintenance technicians.</p> <p>Finally, we have added a chapter that looks more closely at the financial aspects of architectures. In this chapter, we introduce a method--the Cost Benefit Analysis Method (CBAM)--for basing architectural decisions on economic criteria, in addition to the technical criteria that we discussed previously.</p> <p>As in the first edition, we use the Architecture Business Cycle (ABC) as a unifying motif. All of the case studies are described in terms of the quality goals that motivated the system's design and how the system's architecture achieves those goals.</p> <p>In writing the second edition, as with the first, we were very aware that our primary audience is practitioners, and so we have focused on material that has been found useful in many industrial applications as well as what we expect practice to be in the near future.</p> <p>We hope that you enjoy reading this second edition at least as much as we enjoyed writing it. </p> <br> <br> 0321154959P03252003</p><h2>Charles Sheeler: Across Media</h2><p>Charles Sheeler (1883-1965) is recognized as one of the founders of American modernism and one of the master photographers of the twentieth century. His work is synonymous with precisionism, a crisp, clean, hard-edged style that reconciled cubist abstraction and the machine aesthetic of Marcel Duchamp with American subject matter. Trained in industrial drawing, decorative painting, and applied art at the School of Industrial Art in Philadelphia, Sheeler also attended the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, where he learned an impressionistic, painterly style. He later embraced European modernism and taught himself photography. Sheeler fully absorbed the lessons of each discipline and forged his own singular approach.<br><br>This beautifully illustrated book, created to accompany a traveling exhibition of Sheeler&#x2019;s work, features detailed analyses of the artist&#x2019;s mediums and working methods. Focusing on the complex, often paradoxical, relationships among photography, film, drawing, printmaking, and painting that were central to Sheeler&#x2019;s art, this pathbreaking book traces critical points in Sheeler&#x2019;s trajectory, beginning with a small selection of Sheeler&#x2019;s seminal photographs, circa 1917, of the interior of an eighteenth-century Quaker fieldstone house in Doylestown, Pennsylvania. Sections are also devoted to the 1920 film <i>Manhatta,</i> made in collaboration with Paul Strand; a series of commercial photographs of the Ford Motor Company&#x2019;s River Rogue factory (1927); the enigmatic painting <i>The Artist Looks at Nature </i>(1943) and its related works; and finally a group of mill subjects from the 1940s and 1950s that experiments with photomontage.<br><br><b><i>Copub: National Gallery of Art</i></b></p><p><b>Charles Brock </b>is Assistant Curator of American and British paintings at the National Gallery of Art.<i>Starred Review.</i> An important American artist, Charles Sheeler made significant contributions as a photographer, painter, draughtsman, industrial designer and filmmaker, all of which are covered with aplomb in this wonderful overview. Although less well-known than American art world superstars like Hopper, Rothko or Warhol, his approach and aesthetic were influential world-wide, especially on the Precisionist movement, and he numbered Alfred Stieglitz, Walter Arensberg and Maurius de Zayas among his supporters. Brock has done a superb job selecting images, including some dynamic examples of Sheeler's commercial work for Cond� Nast and N.W. Ayers and Sons. There are plenty of color plates, and Brock divides them by type and period, presenting them immediately following the chapter that discusses them rather than collected in an appendix. This facilitates the study of the relevant images while reading and allows the reader to appreciate the relations between works visually, independently of the written analysis. Brock's essays are also consistently excellent, providing a good mix of critical debate over the intricacies of Sheeler's work with straightforward discussion of his long and varied career. The work is definitely lighter on academic analysis, however, and so will appeal immediately to general readers, but a concise bibliography at the end and judicious notes throughout make this a good starting point for readers wishing to delve into the subject in more detail. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Although each academic specialization requires supplementary kanji of its own, there is considerable overlap. With that in mind, this book employs the same methods as Volumes 1 and 2 of <i>Remembering the Kanji</i> to introduce additional characters useful for upper-level proficiency, bringing the total of all three volumes to 3,000 kanji.<br><br>The 3rd edition has been updated to reflect the 196 new kanji approved by the government in 2010, all of which have been relocated in Volume 1. The selection of 800 new kanji is based on frequency lists and cross-checked against a number of standard Japanese kanji dictionaries. <br><br>Separate parts of the book are devoted to learning the writing and reading of these characters. The writing requires only a handful of new &#x201c;primitive elements.&#x201d; A few are introduced as compound primitives (&#x201c;measure words&#x201d;) or as alternative forms for standard kanji. The majority of the kanji are organized according to the elements introduced in Volume 1. <br><br>As in Volume 2, Chinese readings are arranged into groups for easy reference, enabling the student to take advantage of the readings assigned to &#x201c;signal primitives&#x201d; already learned.<br><br>Seven indexes include hand-drawn samples of the new characters introduced and cumulative lists of the key word and primitive meaning, and of the Chinese and Japanese pronunciations, that appear in all 3 volumes of the series.</p></p><p><b>James W.

The 2006 shootings at the schoolhouse in Nickel Mines, Pennsylvania, heightened public interest in this unique people, and their extraordinary acts of compassion in the wake of that tragedy both inspired and puzzled many observers. The Amish themselves do little to satisfy this curiosity, and they trust very few outsiders to do it for them. <p>In this follow-up to the bestselling <i>Amish Grace: How Forgiveness Transcended Tragedy</i>, Donald Kraybill, Steven Nolt, and DavidWeaver-Zercher shed further light on Amish life, this time on their faith and spiritual practices. <i>The Amish Way</i> interprets the distinctive practices of Amish spirituality in their cultural context and explores their relevance for the wider world.

Those with a sympathetic ear often fail to critically examine these creationist claims, leading to an ill-informed public and, perhaps more troubling, ill-advised public policy. As Aron Ra makes clear, however, every single argument deployed by creationists in their attacks on evolution is founded on fundamental scientific, religious, and historical falsehoods&#x2013;all of them. Among their most popular claims is that evolution is a religion, that there are no transitional species, that there are no beneficial mutations, and that supposedly sacred scripture is the infallible word of God. Yet, as the evidence and data plainly show, each of these claims is demonstrably and unequivocally false. There is simply no truth to creationism whatsoever, and the entire enterprise rests on a foundation of falsehoods. This book explains and exposes the worst of these lies, and should be read by all who honestly care about following the evidence no matter where it might lead in pursuit of the truth.</p><p><b>Aron Ra</b> is a science educator, secular activist, debater, and public speaker. He cohosts the Ra-Men podcast and writes at Reason Advocates on the Patheos network. He is the former Texas state director of American Atheists and current president of Atheist Alliance of America. He is also heading the Phylogeny Explorer Project, an effort to render the entire evolutionary tree of life as a navigable online encyclopedia. He is best known for his popular video series exposing the foundational falsehoods of creationism."This book demonstrates once again that Aron Ra is a master of eloquence, and of cutting to the chase with precision. This is an enjoyable read even for the well informed. But we often forget how embarrassingly uninformed biblical literalists are. This delightfully written takedown will educate and embarrass them all over again." &#x2014; Richard Carrier, Ph.D., author, <i>On the Historicity of Jesus</i><br><br>&#x201c;Diogenes, you can retire now! Aron Ra, a remarkable figure in many ways, is an indefatigable opponent of hokum, whether religious or pseudoscientific in nature . . . . In this book Aron trains his analytical guns on &#x2018;scientific&#x2019; creationism. Do you think this is a matter of beating a dead Eohippus? It is not, because pseudoscience and superstition never sleep, and their proponents never tire of seeking (and gaining!) government support to turn back the clock and to cripple science education precisely at the time our great country can least afford such charlatanism.&#x201d; &#x2014;Robert M. Price, co-author, <i>Evolving out of Eden</i><br><br>"The seemingly unquenchable popularity of the so-called 'paranormal' has long been a puzzle, both to me and to my good friend Aron Ra. However, Aron&#x2019;s much more important and more specific interest in preoccupation with woo-woo is bifold: religion &amp; creationism &#x2014; to the study of which he has given much thought and concern. His book <i>Foundational Falsehoods of Creationism</i> brings to our stunned attention the farcical, juvenile, pseudoscientific claims with which so many cultures, worldwide, have occupied themselves for centuries, and to which they have so willingly surrendered on their way to the abattoir. . . Aron&#x2019;s rage &#x2014; along with his concern &#x2014; is very evident as he takes his reader step-by-step along the bumpy road he has researched and probed to illustrate just how juvenile that a belief in angels, heaven &#x2014; and hell, eternal life, promised rewards and penalties, can be unless we wake up and see the Earth upon which we live as a home that doesn&#x2019;t need abject nonsense to make it wondrous and exciting. Those who choose to believe that the fossil record can be disregarded, that humans were designed and manufactured 'as is' and just 'happened,' who surrender on their knees to ghosts that just aren&#x2019;t there, should settle down and read Aron Ra very carefully and should seriously think &#x2014; that&#x2019;s the word! &#x2014; about what he&#x2019;s written." &#x2014;James Randi, author,&nbsp;<i>An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural</i></p><h2>Kaizen and the Art of Creative Thinking</h2><p><p>Once again Dr. Shigeo Shingo will amaze you.

Authors Shaffer, Deller, and Marcouiller review the economics of smaller communities with continued emphasis on how to build and achieve theoretically sound community economic development policy. The text also demonstrates how local participation and knowledge can be used to identify problems, form solutions, and maintain community support for long-term goals.<br> <p>The main body of economic research and literature has neglected the economics of smaller communities. <i>Community Economics: Linking Theory and Practice</i> fills that information void.

His famous autobiographies present him overcoming unimaginable trials to gain his freedom and establish his identity-all in service to his public role as an abolitionist. But in both the public and domestic spheres, Douglass relied on a complicated array of relationships with women: white and black, slave-mistresses and family, political collaborators and intellectual companions, wives and daughters. And the great man needed them throughout a turbulent life that was never so linear and self-made as he often wished to portray it.<br><br>In <em>Women in the World of Frederick Douglass</em>, Leigh Fought illuminates the life of the famed abolitionist off the public stage. She begins with the women he knew during his life as a slave: his mother, from whom he was separated; his grandmother, who raised him; his slave mistresses, including the one who taught him how to read; and his first wife, Anna Murray, a free woman who helped him escape to freedom and managed the household that allowed him to build his career. Fought examines Douglass's varied relationships with white women-including Maria Weston Chapman, Julia Griffiths, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Ottilie Assing--who were crucial to the success of his newspapers, were active in the antislavery and women's movements, and promoted his work nationally and internationally. She also considers Douglass's relationship with his daughter Rosetta, who symbolized her parents' middle class prominence but was caught navigating between their public and private worlds. Late in life, Douglass remarried to a white woman, Helen Pitts, who preserved his papers, home, and legacy for history. <br><br>By examining the circle of women around Frederick Douglass, this work brings these figures into sharper focus and reveals a fuller and more complex image of the self-proclaimed "woman's rights man."<br></p><p><br><strong>Leigh Fought</strong> is Associate Professor of History at LeMoyne College. She is the author of <em>Southern Womanhood and Slavery: A Biography of Louisa S. McCord</em> and an editor of <em>The Frederick Douglass Papers: Series Three: Correspondence, Volume 1: 1842-1852</em>.<br><br>"While Fought's approach provides insight into the subtleties of Douglass's beliefs and position, more importantly, it reveals the motivations and beliefs of the women who allied themselves with Douglass." -- Julie Roy Jeffrey , <em>Journal of American Ethnic History</em><p></p><br>"Fought's skill at teasing out Anna Murray Douglass's life and character without any documents written in her own hand is impressive. Anna comes to the reader not the shadowy figure she was to Douglass's acquaintences, but a well-rounded character whose motivations and reactions are grounded in the realities of life as a black woman in the nineteenth century. Overall, this book is not just a well-researched work of history, but an enjoyable read as well." -- Stephanie J. Richmond, <em>H-Net</em><p></p><br>"[Douglass's] life, argues the author persuasively, was shaped by women... A fresh and insightful perspective on a major historical figure."--<em>Kirkus</em><p></p><br>"[Frederick Douglass was] one of the age's most passionate male feminists, as Leigh Fought shows in <em>Women in the World of Frederick Douglass</em>, a fresh and surprising account of Douglass's life."--Fergus M. Bordewich, <em>Wall Street Journal</em><p></p><br>"This is a fascinating account of an impressive man and the equally accomplished women who supported his monumental efforts to secure freedom and rights for blacks and women."--<em>Booklist</em>, Starred Review<p></p><br>"By making its focus those indomitable and sometimes troubling women, Fought has written an engaging book that is compelling, sometimes even fierce, and extremely relevant."--<em>Arts Fuse</em> <br><p></p><br>"[T]horoughly researched....Although the complex nature of Douglass's relationships with women will never be fully understood, Fought unveils how women were attracted to Douglass and how he equated the servitude of race to that of gender."--John David Smith, <em>The North Carolina Historical Review</em><p></p><br>"For anyone interested in women's history, this book--well-researched and well-written--is a compelling read."--<em>Civil War News</em><p></p><br>"Historian Leigh Fought has written a path-breaking, biographical account of Frederick Douglass through the eyes of the women who influenced him. Fought, a skillful researcher and gifted writer, has been working on the book for years and the final product does not disappoint."--Eric J.Chaput, <em>Providence Journal</em> <br><p></p><br>"Leigh Fought reimagines Douglass's life by placing women at the center of the narrative. She offers vivid portraits of the relatives, friends, and sister activists-enslaved and free, black and white, American and British--who provided Douglass with critical emotional, material, intellectual, and political support. These women helped shape and sustain Douglass throughout his life and ensured his legacy for future generations; their legacy, too, is now ensured in this lively and lucid book." - Nancy A. Hewitt, author of <em>No Permanent Waves: Recasting Histories of U.S. Feminism</em><p></p><br>"In this well-researched and richly textured book, Leigh Fought gives us a fascinating new view into the life and times of one our most famous and revered figures: Frederick Douglass. As he freely acknowledged, women helped make Douglass the man he became. So we, too, are in debt to the women whose stories come so vividly alive in these pages." - Annette Gordon-Reed, author of <em>The Hemingses of Monticello: An American Family</em><p></p><br>"Fought's book takes us into the Douglass households and makes them come alive. Two wives, two intimate European friends, a grandmother, a fascinating daughter, many granddaughters, as well as fictive sisters and other kin all inhabit this work of deep scholarship. Fought is an intrepid researcher and lucid writer with superb judgment. The women and Douglass himself come alive anew through these crucial relationships; the man who expressed so little about his private life is here brought under a bright light, not with prurience, but with analytical understanding and keen sympathy. This is the most important Douglass book in many years." - David W. Blight, Yale University<p></p><br>"With meticulous research and judicious analysis, Leigh Fought resurrects the women who until now lay hidden in the shadows of Frederick Douglass's storied life.

Such series often provide questions with little guidance, leaving students to their own devices. They thus tend to overlook the role of teaching in the church. By contrast, Knowing the Bible avoids the problem by providing substantial instruction with the questions. Knowing the Bible then goes even further by showing how any given passage connects with the gospel, the whole Bible, and Christian theology. I heartily endorse this orientation of individual books to the whole Bible and the gospel, and I applaud the demonstration that sound theology was not something invented later by Christians, but is right there in the pages of Scripture.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Graeme Goldsworthy,</strong>&nbsp;Former Lecturer in Old Testament, Biblical Theology, and Hermeneutics, Moore Theological College</p><p>&#x201c;What a gift to earnest, Bible-loving, Bible-searching believers!

Students of the Word are led to understand the content of passages through perceptive, guided questions, and they are given rich insights and application all along the way in the brief but illuminating sections that conclude each study. What potential growth in depth and breadth of understanding these studies offer.

A Books of Wonder� Classic.</p><p>That Alice. When she's not traipsing after a rabbit into Wonderland, she's gallivanting off into the topsy-turvy world behind the drawing-room looking glass. In <i>Through the Looking Glass</i>, Lewis Carroll's masterful and zany sequel to <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i>, she makes more eccentric acquaintances, including Tweedledee and Tweedledum, the White Queen, and a somewhat grumpy Humpty Dumpty. Through a giant and elaborate chess game, Alice explores this odd country, where one must eat dry biscuits to quench thirst, and run like the wind to stay in one place. As in life, Alice must stay on her toes to learn the rules of this game. <i>Through the Looking Glass</i> immediately took its rightful place beside its partner on the shelf of eternal classics. And luckily for generations of enraptured children, Carroll was again able to persuade John Tenniel to create the fantastic woodblock engravings that have become so indelibly associated with the Alice stories. For almost 130 years, Alice's curious adventures have amused, perplexed, and delighted readers, young and old. This gorgeous, deluxe boxed set of both volumes contains engravings from Tenniel's original woodblocks that were discovered in a London bank in 1985, and reproduced for the first time here.

Younger begins with the living traditions, describing the community of Ditcitars, the two hundred priests of the temple who carry on an ancient tradition involving six worship periods each day, and discusses in detail the elaborate temple festivals, which attract up to 200,000 people. He analyzes the three hundred inscriptions on the temple walls, and seeks to determine from them, and from the evidence of art history, when the many components of the temple were constructed and what innovations in the worship tradition they made possible. Using the inscriptions and the abundant literature about the temple, he also addresses the complex historical questions regarding roles played by famous kings and saints of the region in the life of the temple.<br> The traditions of the Citamparam temple reflect the worship style of all important Hindu temples, and its history is central to all history, literature, and thought of South India. This unique study acknowledges the centrality of the temple in Indian life and society, and provides a vivid and engaging portrait of South India's living religion for students of religious studies, Asian studies, and Indian civilization.<br></p><p>Paul Younger is at McMaster University."This well-researched and lucidly written book is a welcome addition to the study of Hindu temples and their functioning....this book will definitely enhance further visits and research." -- Anne-Marie Gaston, Pacific Affairs<br><br>"Paul Younger's study of the Temple to Natarajan, the dancing form of Sivan, in Citamparam, Tamil Nadu, is a tour de force"--Journal of Religion<br><br>"It deserves the attention of all students of Tamil religion and should find a place in scholarly libraries covering South Asia."--Glenn Yocum, The Journal of Asian Studies</p><h2>Haircoloring and Chemical Texture Services Supplement for Milady&#x2019;s Standard Cosmetology 2008</h2><p>This full-color, spiral bound supplement to the leading cosmetology textbook in the marketplace, Milady&#39;s Standard Textbook of Cosmetology, provides procedures for 10 different texturing and 9 different coloring procedures.

It bridges the gap between traditional textbooks on the subject and the popular accounts which assume little or no background in the physical sciences on the part of the reader. The first edition has been carefully revised throughout to provide an up-to-date and comprehensive overview of this fascinating subject. There are also four completely new chapters covering quantum gravity, super-unification, the relationship between particle physics and cosmology, and superstrings. Historical developments are discussed, together with the most important recent experiments, and the theoretical development of the subject is traced from its foundations in relativity and quantum mechanics through to the very latest theories. The book is intended for anyone with a background in the physical sciences who wishes to learn about particle physics. It will also be of value to students of physics wishing to gain an introductory overview of the subject before getting down to the details of the formalism.</p><p>This third edition is a readable introduction to the world of particle physics for anyone with a background in the physical sciences. It covers the important concepts from the foundations of quantum mechanics and relativity to the most recent particle discoveries and the formulation of modern string theory.James L.

The attraction was immediate, and within two months they were in love. Because Algren was so alien to de Beauvoir's world, she spent time describing events and people to him she might otherwise have taken for granted. The result is that de Beauvoir's 300 surviving letters to Algren are unusually rich in detail--love letters with a conscious undercurrent of French social history. Translated and annotated by Kate Leblanc, they offer amusing insights into postwar Parisian life and characters, delivered with the charm of the nonnative writer. <p> In one letter, de Beauvoir sums up Albert Camus as "an interesting but difficult guy. When he was not pleased with the book he was writing, he was very arrogant; now, he has got a rather great success and he has become very modest and sincere." She coolly describes a dinner party where she witnessed the separation of the apexes of mind and body: "Sartre was alone in a corner, eating sadly some corned-beef, and I sat in front of Rita Hayworth, trying to speak to her, and looking at her beautiful shoulders and breasts which could have made so many men crazy but which were so useless for me." This is essential reading for devotees of the Paris literary scene and other literary romantics. <i>--Regina Marler</i></p>Simone de Beauvoir (1908-1986) is best known for her existentialist and feminist writing, including The Second Sex, The Mandarins (winner of the Prix Goncourt), The Coming of Age, and America Day by Day. Editor of the monthly Paris review Les Temps Modernes with her lifelong companion, writer and philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, she met novelist Nelson Algren (1909-1981), author of Never Come Morning, The Man With the Golden Arm (winner of the National Book Award), The Neon Wilderness, and A Walk on the Wild Side, in Chicago in 1947.</p><h2>The Fixed Period (Trollope, Penguin)</h2><p>Tells of a moral and political dilemma on the imaginary Pacific island of Britannula.

Drawing upon a wide range of women's sources--memoirs, letters, essays, journalistic articles, fiction, treatises, and extensive oral histories--Margot Badran shows how Egyptian women assumed agency and in so doing subverted and refigured the conventional patriarchal order. Unsettling a common claim that "feminism is Western" and dismantling the alleged opposition between feminism and Islam, the book demonstrates how the Egyptian feminist movement in the first half of this century both advanced the nationalist cause and worked within the parameters of Islam.</p></p><p><b>Margot Badran</b> is Professor of Women's Studies and History at Oberlin College. A specialist in the Middle East, she translated, edited, and introduced <i>Harem Years: The Memoirs of an Egyptian Feminist, Huda Shaarawi</i> and is coeditor of <i>Opening the Gates: A Century of Arab Feminist Writing.</i>"Most accounts of modern Egyptian history focus on and are written by men. This one is different--and welcome. It traces the development of Egyptian nationalist sentiment by concentrating on the emergence of Egyptian feminism, [from] the rise of 'feminist consciousness' [to] the creation of explicitly political feminist organizations." (<i>Foreign Affairs</i>)<br><br>"Badran ... challenge[s] the notion that feminism is only a Western creation and that it is incompatible with Islam....

Now the three brothers are together again &#x2013; but will Dimitry&#x2019;s bitter quarrel with Fyodor spoil their homecoming? Dimitry and his father both want to marry the beautiful Grushenka.

Its products--the currently prevailing theories of physics, astronomy, and cosmology--have proved themselves to possess intrinsic beauty and to have enormous explanatory and predictive power. This anthology of primary readings chronicles the birth and maturation of five such theories (the heliocentric theory, the electromagnetic field theory, special and general relativity, quantum theory, and the big bang theory) in the words of the scientists who brought them to life. It is the first historical account that captures the rich substance of these theories, each of which represents a fascinating story of the interplay of evidence and insight--and of dialogue among great minds.</p><br><p> Readers sit in with Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo as they overturn the geocentric universe; observe the genius of Faraday and Maxwell as they "discover" the electromagnetic field; look over Einstein's shoulder as he works out the details of relativity; listen in as Einstein and Bohr argue for the soul of quantum mechanics in the Completeness Debate; and watch as Hubble and others reveal the history of the universe.</p><br><p> The editors' approach highlights the moments of discovery that rise from scientific creativity, and the presentation humanizes the scientific process, revealing the extent to which great scientists were the first to consider the philosophical implications of their work. But, most significantly, the editors offer this as their central thesis: although each was ushered in by a revolution, and each contains counterintuitive elements that delayed its acceptance, these five theories exhibit a continuous rational development that has led them to a permanent place in the worldview of science.</p><br><p> Accessible to the general reader yet sufficiently substantive that working scientists will find value in it, <i>The Tests of Time</i> offers an intimate look into how physical theory has been developed, by the brilliant people who have developed it.</p></p><p><p>"This excellent work collects a judiciously chosen group of writings on what are universally regarded as five of the most significant physical theories in the history of science. Each of the selections serves to place the development and significance of the physical theory in its historical setting as well as to shed light on important philosophical issues it raises. This is an extremely useful book that will be of benefit to anyone with an interest in the history and philosophy of science. I for one will certainly be using this volume as a source book for my courses in the history and philosophy of the physical sciences."<b>--Martin Tamny, The City College and the Graduate Center, City University of New York</b></p><p>"It is a pleasure to find an original addition to the small list of worthwhile books on the history and philosophy of natural science. The authors have done an excellent job assembling and organizing a selection of texts that can be used equally well at an elementary or more advanced level. No other anthology combines breadth and accuracy so well."<b>--Stephen Toulmin, University of Southern California</b></p><p>"This book is the result of an ambitious educational project to teach students by having them study original scientific texts selected with pedagogical shrewdness. It makes it possible for students to engage in actual scientific thinking and to do this almost entirely without mathematics and in the intellectual presence of great and imaginative creative scientists. There is no other work like it, and it has great appeal."<b>--Robert S. Cohen, Boston University</b></p><b>Lisa M. Dolling</b>, <b>Arthur F. Gianelli</b>, and <b>Glenn N.

His inquiry, documented in this book, takes us beyond social circumstances and into the deeper forces that shape our very existence as modern individuals. The modern individual, Dumm suggests, is fundamentally a lonely self. Through reflections on philosophy, political theory, literature, and tragic drama, he proceeds to illuminate a hidden dimension of the human condition. His book shows how loneliness shapes the contemporary division between public and private, our inability to live with each other honestly and in comity, the estranged forms that our intimate relationships assume, and the weakness of our common bonds.</p><p>A reading of the relationship between Cordelia and her father in Shakespeare&#x2019;s <i>King Lear</i> points to the most basic dynamic of modern loneliness&#x2015;how it is a response to the problem of the &#x201c;missing mother.&#x201d; Dumm goes on to explore the most important dimensions of lonely experience&#x2015;Being, Having, Loving, and Grieving. As the book unfolds, he juxtaposes new interpretations of iconic cultural texts&#x2015;<i>Moby-Dick</i>, <i>Death of a Salesman</i>, the film <i>Paris</i>, <i>Texas</i>, Emerson&#x2019;s &#x201c;Experience,&#x201d; to name a few&#x2015;with his own experiences of loneliness, as a son, as a father, and as a grieving husband and widower. </p><p>Written with deceptive simplicity, <i>Loneliness as a Way of Life</i> is something rare&#x2015;an intellectual study that is passionately personal. It challenges us, not to overcome our loneliness, but to learn how to re-inhabit it in a better way. To fail to do so, this book reveals, will only intensify the power that it holds over us.</p></p><p>Thomas Dumm is William H. Hastie &#x2019;25 Professor of Political Science at Amherst College. He has received a Guggenheim Fellowship and is the author of <i>Loneliness as a Way of Life</i> (Harvard), <i>A Politics of the Ordinary</i>, and <i>Democracy and Punishment: Disciplinary Origins of the United States</i>.&#x201c;<i>Loneliness as a Way of Life</i> is a book about coming to believe in this world, a world in which loneliness is inevitable and connections are still possible. It is also a risky book, because of the way Dumm weaves the personal into the literary and both into politics. The risk is well run: Dumm's is an untimely piece, essential for the time in which we live.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>William E. Connolly</b><br><br>&#x201c;Avoiding cynicism and sentimentality alike, Thomas Dumm's penetrating and painfully personal meditations on the modern condition of loneliness may show us more about ourselves than we can easily bear. Through subtle and provocative readings of Shakespeare, Melville, Arendt, and other thinkers, Dumm finds terms for acknowledging and inhabiting his own loneliness, and perhaps ours as well. His calm yet insistently disarming voice claims and challenges us, even when we resist it.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Robert Gooding-Williams, author of <i>Look, A Negro!: Philosophical Essays on Race, Culture, and Politics</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Thomas Dumm is a wise guide and learned counselor for the great Socratic question: How to live? We are deeply enriched owing to his wisdom and compassion.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Cornel West</b><br><br>&#x201c;[Dumm] uses the works of past writers and philosophers such as Shakespeare, Thoreau, and Foucault, along with personal reflections on his feelings after the death of his wife, to explain the multifaceted nature of loneliness. Dumm concludes that loneliness isn't something that we overcome, but it is part of our psychological, political, and social lives. We all share these common areas of loneliness, and only through reflecting on them can we gain a better understanding of how to live with our loneliness.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Scott Duimstra</b><b>, </b><b><i>Library Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Loneliness as a Way of Life</i> doesn't try to be cut-and-dried. It is quizzical, often deeply skeptical, about our intentions as a species. It recognizes that society--and sociability--are messy affairs that bring mixed blessings. Especially in his last, rousing chapter on Emerson, freedom, and responsibility, Mr. Dumm offers a way out of the morass he has described. He makes no false claims that we can vanquish loneliness or fix our thinking in a fresh groove. Instead, he proposes the tempered idea that friendship and group accountability can--indeed, must--live together with our existential solitude.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Christopher Lane</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Sun</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The greatest writers may have shown how language itself is inadequate to the experience of loneliness. But we have written our experience of loneliness deeply into the language. That too, though, goes to underscore the point that Mr. Dumm's honest book makes: While the "lonely self will always be with us," we can at least come together in search of imaginative ways of expressing that loneliness. We can "write and read to tell each other how we are to be lonely together."&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Andrew Stark</b><b>, </b><b><i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[A] meditative and intensely personal volume.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Sarah Barmak</b><b>, </b><b><i>Toronto Star</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;An intriguing volume...This modern world may be the "way of loneliness," but readers should not shy away from the state. In fact, Dumm asserts that loneliness is the impetus that gives us autonomy, the ability to make decisions on our own terms. Although the feeling may be painful, it is only through loneliness that we become true individuals able to make rational decisions and able to interact with others as rational beings. And, in an odd twist, it is this true sense of self-awareness that leads us to seek the community of others.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Orli Low</b><b>, </b><b><i>Los Angeles Times</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;For Dumm, loneliness is really about loss. He argues that we have to be willing to reflect on the tragic dimensions of human existence, including the inevitability of our own deaths, to face and ameliorate our loneliness...Only through earnest reflection and a willingness to examine how we live our lives can the ache of loneliness be transformed into its less painful companion: solitude.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Katharine Mieszkowski</b><b>, </b><b><i>Salon</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This is a fascinating book. Dumm articulates the intuition that many of the ways in which we understand our communal existence within a polity, ranging from the distinction between the public and the private spheres to the weakness of our interpersonal attachments, stem from the loneliness that is manifested within the modern world. Believing that loneliness is resistant to the traditional philosophical approach of describing the phenomenon at hand, then analyzing and critiquing it, Dumm draws on several important artistic works (from <i>King Lear</i>, to <i>Moby-Dick</i>, to the film <i>Paris, Texas</i>) to explore this issue and to illuminate his intuitions concerning it. Just as this volume is not a traditional philosophical treatise, it is not a traditional volume of literary criticism, for Dumm is deeply and personally involved with the subject of loneliness, and he reaches into his own experiences of it to explore it more fully.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>J.

Enter Michael Coleman: multiple killer, death-row resident . . . and, if he is willing, human guinea pig. There are no promises. The effects may kill Coleman or completely destroy his sanity. He agrees to the experiment, with results so astonishing that the research must continue--but not in prison. Given a new identity and new employer, Katherine Lyon, Coleman reenters society. And that&#39;s when a plot far darker than science alone could construct begins to emerge. A carefully researched science and psychological thriller, Blood of Heaven is a nonstop page turner that looks deep into the heart of man, examining the nature of good and evil, flesh versus spirit, and the ever-growing controversy over genetically determined behavior.</p><p>Bill Myers is the author of McGee and Me!, The Incredible World of Wally McDoogle, Forbidden Doors, Christ B.C., and Journeys to Fayrah.

How important is it to the fates of Iraq, Iran, Israel, and Lebanon? Based on unique and extraordinary access to Syria&#x2019;s President Bashar al-Asad, his circle, and his family, this book tells Syria&#x2019;s inside story. David W. Lesch presents the essential account of this country and its enigmatic leader at a critical juncture in the history of the Middle East.<p></p>Syria has been called the crossroads of civilization for millennia. Lately, however, it is a nation more in the crosshairs than the crossroads. From the U.S. perspective, Syria is on the wrong side of history with respect to Iraq, Israel, Lebanon, the global war on terrorism, and the growth of democracy in the Middle East. Bashar al-Asad assumed the presidency in 2000 after the long reign of his father, Hafiz al-Asad, and soon encountered momentous regional and international events. Bashar&#x2019;s efforts to integrate his country into this changing environment without being coerced have met with some success and some failure. The fate of Syria, very much tied to its young ophthalmologist-turned-president, will profoundly affect what type of Middle East emerges in the near future.<p></p></p><p><b>David W.

Progressing from the simple to the more advanced topics, it goes beyond the well developed area of linear elastic fracture mechanics to consider the dynamic and elastic-plastic regimes, and in doing so, extends the subject into a broader range of realistic engineering applications.</p><p>Fracture mechanics is a subject that has not yet fully matured. Yet, it has existed long enough, and its practical applications are important enough, that a great deal of information is already available. Nevertheless, we wrote this book believing that fracture mechanics is currently at a unique stage.

A. Bradshaw explores the minds, emotions, and lives of elephants. Wars, starvation, mass culls, poaching, and habitat loss have reduced elephant numbers from more than ten million to a few hundred thousand, leaving orphans bereft of the elders who would normally mentor them. As a consequence, traumatized elephants have become aggressive against people, other animals, and even one another; their behavior is comparable to that of humans who have experienced genocide, other types of violence, and social collapse. By exploring the elephant mind and experience in the wild and in captivity, Bradshaw bears witness to the breakdown of ancient elephant cultures.</p><p>All is not lost. People are working to save elephants by rescuing orphaned infants and rehabilitating adult zoo and circus elephants, using the same principles psychologists apply in treating humans who have survived trauma. Bradshaw urges us to support these and other models of elephant recovery and to solve pressing social and environmental crises affecting all animals, human or not.</p></p><p><p>Q: How did you become interested in elephants and their welfare?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A: Often, when people who work with elephants are asked this question, they answer, The elephants chose me.&#x201d; And I have to say that has been my case. From a more rational perspective, my decision to study elephants was compelled by their obvious suffering.&nbsp; The stress has been so extreme that it has led to such un-elephant-like behavior what the media refers to as elephant violence.&#x201d; Changes in behavior from what is considered normal don't just happen out of the blue; there are reasons for them. I wanted to understand the nature of elephant trauma, the causes of their psychological anguish, and how to help the elephants.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Q: What is it about elephants that inspires you?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A: They are honest and straightforward, and prize relationships above all. Elephants embody so many qualities that we humans admire, and offer a model and inspiration for what we can become.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Q: What hopes do you have for the future of elephants?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A: We have to be concerned about the present. It is not just the future, but the conditions under which elephants live today that are so dire. We need to pay attention to the great suffering of individual elephants and other wildlife, and urgently remedy these situations. If we can fix the present, we can fix the future.</p><b>G. A.

Our old definitions of urban, suburban, and rural fail to capture the complexity of these vast regions with their superhighways, subdivisions, industrial areas, office parks, and resort areas pushing far out into the countryside. Detractors call it sprawl and assert that it is economically inefficient, socially inequitable, environmentally irresponsible, and aesthetically ugly. Robert Bruegmann calls it a logical consequence of economic growth and the democratization of society, with benefits that urban planners have failed to recognize. <br><br>In his incisive history of the expanded city, Bruegmann overturns every assumption we have about sprawl. Taking a long view of urban development, he demonstrates that sprawl is neither recent nor particularly American but as old as cities themselves, just as characteristic of ancient Rome and eighteenth-century Paris as it is of Atlanta or Los Angeles. Nor is sprawl the disaster claimed by many contemporary observers. Although sprawl, like any settlement pattern, has undoubtedly produced problems that must be addressed, it has also provided millions of people with the kinds of mobility, privacy, and choice that were once the exclusive prerogatives of the rich and powerful. <br><br>The first major book to strip urban sprawl of its pejorative connotations, <i>Sprawl</i> offers a completely new vision of the city and its growth. Bruegmann leads readers to the powerful conclusion that "in its immense complexity and constant change, the city-whether dense and concentrated at its core, looser and more sprawling in suburbia, or in the vast tracts of exurban penumbra that extend dozens, even hundreds, of miles-is the grandest and most marvelous work of mankind." <br><br>&#x201c;Largely missing from this debate [over sprawl] has been a sound and reasoned history of this pattern of living. With Robert Bruegmann&#x2019;s <i>Sprawl: A Compact History</i>, we now have one. What a pleasure it is: well-written, accessible and eager to challenge the current cant about sprawl.&#x201d;&#x2014;Joel Kotkin, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br>&#x201c;There are scores of books offering &#x2018;solutions&#x2019; to sprawl. Their authors would do well to read this book.&#x201d;&#x2014;Witold Rybczynski, <i>Slate </i></p><p><b>Robert Bruegmann</b> is chair of and professor in the Department of Art History at the University of Illinois at Chicago as well as professor in the School of Architecture and the Program in Urban Planning. His many books include <i>The Architects and the City: Holabird &amp; Roche of Chicago, 1880-1918</i>, also published by the University of Chicago Press. <br><p>"After 70 years of suffering the slings and arrows of academic criticism, suburban life finally finds a compelling defender in Bruegmann<b>.</b> A professor of art history and urban planning at the University of Illinois&#x2013;Chicago, Bruegmann demonstrates that urban sprawl is a natural process as old as the world's oldest cities, wherein large metropolises reach a point of maturity and those with financial means escape the congestion and high prices of city life. What has changed over the past century, the author says, is that an increasing number of citizens have achieved the financial means to participate in what was once an exclusive luxury of the wealthy. Bruegmann acknowledges that the effects on cities are not always positive, but he also demonstrates that many of the criticisms of suburban sprawl&#x2014;e.g., that it is culturally deficient and environmentally noxious&#x2014;are greatly exaggerated and ignore the very real benefits sprawl offers in terms of privacy, mobility and choice. With his disdain for doomsday predictions and his disregard for the academic consensus, Bruegmann's thorough analysis is sure to be controversial, but a shot of controversy ought to do the field, and public dialogue about it, some good."--<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br></p> (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>"Almost compulsively contrarian." (Alan Ehrenhalt <i>Governing Magazine</i>)<br><br>"There are scores of books offering 'solutions' to sprawl. Their authors would do well to read this book.

Bruegmann takes us through them lucidly and economically, neither flinching from nor getting mired in detail, and steering deftly between neo-con smugness and liberal anguish. These qualities make <i>Sprawl</i> a textbook for our times.&#x201d; (Andrew Saint <i>London Review of Books</i> 2006-04-06)<br><br>"If you have not read <i>Sprawl: A Compact History</i>, drop everything, obtain a copy and read it. It is the most important book on the American landscape since Jane Jacobs' <i>The Death and Life of Great American Cities</i>. Do not be deceived. <i>Sprawl</i> is as much about cities as it is about suburbs; as much about England, France, Germany, and Russia as it is about the United States; and as much about the early 21st century exurb as it is about 19th century slums or ancient Rome. It succeeds as a deeply illuminating work because of Robert Bruegmann's unique position among urbanists: He combines an insistence on looking at what is actually on the landscape with an encyclopedic knowledge with the literature on cities. The result is a keen observer able to identify striking relationships. . . . . You may think you know this material.

With the imperial vestments dispatched to Constantinople, the curtain fell on the Roman empire in Western Europe, its territories divided among successor kingdoms constructed around barbarian military manpower. <br><br>But, if the Roman Empire was dead, Romans across much of the old empire still lived, holding on to their lands, their values, and their institutions. The conquering barbarians, responding to Rome's continuing psychological dominance and the practical value of many of its institutions, were ready to reignite the imperial flame and enjoy the benefits. As Peter Heather shows in dazzling biographical portraits, each of the three greatest immediate contenders for imperial power--Theoderic, Justinian, and Charlemagne--operated with a different power base but was astonishingly successful in his own way. Though each in turn managed to put back together enough of the old Roman West to stake a plausible claim to the Western imperial title, none of their empires long outlived their founders' deaths. Not until the reinvention of the papacy in the eleventh century would Europe's barbarians find the means to establish a new kind of Roman Empire, one that has lasted a thousand years.<br><br>A sequel to the bestselling <em>Fall of the Roman Empire,</em> <em>The Restoration of Rome</em> offers a captivating narrative of the death of an era and the birth of the Catholic Church.<br></p><p><br><strong>Peter Heather </strong>is Professor of Medieval History at King's College London.

Here are interviews with 42 people who represent the movies' golden, influential agethe 1920s through the 1940sand who express personal, sometimes arguable opinions on life in the sternly run studios. Oddly enough, the collection includes the thoughts of only one male star, Joel McCrea, but his anecdotes tell of intriguing dimensions in other memorable leading men of his time. The spotlight remains, for the most part, on the women immortalized on the screen. The book's plentiful photos remind one of the famous words uttered by Kobal's first subject, Gloria Swanson: "We had faces then." Joan Crawford, Katharine Hepburn, Louise Brooks, Joan Blondell, Barbara Stanwyck and many other unforgettables speak their minds on their work and their relations with each other. So do eminent directors, choreographers, scriptwriters and costume designers. The result is an unusually appealing, informative volume by an author whose articulate and stylish writing frequently reveals more than do the accounts of his glamorous respondents. January 30<br>Copyright 1985 Reed Business Information, Inc.Film historian Kobal has spent 20 years collecting these interviews with 29 women and 14 men, all about Hollywood's heyday. The emphasis is on the glamour side: some of Hollywood's best actresses are here, including Hepburn, Bergman, and Crawford, along with some from earlier days who are not well known. The only actor represented is Joel McCrea; the other men are directors, photographers, etc. Kobal prefaces most of the verbatim interviews with a scene-setting introduction in rather syrupy prose and sometimes interjects notes describing tone of voice or body language.

As a young man, he learned the morals, manners, and knowledge necessary to become a Virginia gentleman. He was particularly interested in the military arts and western expansion. At the age of 16, he helped survey Shenandoah lands. At the age of 22, he was commissioned a lieutenant colonel and fought in the first battles of what became the French and Indian War. Unanimously elected as the first President of the United States, Washington served two terms before retiring to Mount Vernon.

Six eccentric fictional authorities, including sex-changing Natty Ampersand and Medievalist Vargas Scronx, give the book a sense of send-up in addition to its trusty practicality. A farouche faun with cloven hoofs, black rats, sirens and sphinxes, turbaned serpents, dragons, brigands and a butler make their appearance in unforgettable sentences and imaginary landscapes, such as brooding Trajikistan, to beguile the reader through such confusions and corrections as dangling and misplaced modifiers, double negatives, parallel construction, and a voluptuous riot of word abuses and preferable usage.<br><br>Gordon also tames such confusing grammatical beasts as the elliptical clause, split infinitives, and many more.

As always, Karen Elizabeth Gordon's sample sentences are beguiling enough to distract even the staunchest logophile from the matter at hand. Nonetheless, she manages to tidily dispose of some of the English language's most ancient and troublesome dilemmas, from the difference between "affect" and "effect" to the intricacies of the split-infinitive debate. Enhanced by the tiny, whimsical line drawings of Rikki Ducornet, this is one styleguide you just might read like a novel.Karen Elizabeth Gordon is the author of <b>The Deluxe Transitive Vampire, The New Well-Tempered Sentence, The Ravenous Muse, The Red Shoes and Other Tattered Tales, The Disheveled Dictionary</b>, and <b>Paris Out of Hand: A Wayward Guide</b>.

The name of the remote New Hampshire town where representatives of forty-four nations gathered in July 1944, in the midst of the century's second great war, has become shorthand for enlightened globalization. The actual story surrounding the historic Bretton Woods accords, however, is full of startling drama, intrigue, and rivalry, which are vividly brought to life in Benn Steil's epic account.</p><p>Upending the conventional wisdom that Bretton Woods was the product of an amiable Anglo-American collaboration, Steil shows that it was in reality part of a much more ambitious geopolitical agenda hatched within President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Treasury and aimed at eliminating Britain as an economic and political rival. At the heart of the drama were the antipodal characters of John Maynard Keynes, the renowned and revolutionary British economist, and Harry Dexter White, the dogged, self-made American technocrat. Bringing to bear new and striking archival evidence, Steil offers the most compelling portrait yet of the complex and controversial figure of White&#x2015;the architect of the dollar's privileged place in the Bretton Woods monetary system, who also, very privately, admired Soviet economic planning and engaged in clandestine communications with Soviet intelligence officials and agents over many years.</p><p>A remarkably deft work of storytelling that reveals how the blueprint for the postwar economic order was actually drawn, <i>The Battle of Bretton Woods</i> is destined to become a classic of economic and political history.</p></p><p><p>"Benn Steil has written a wonderfully rich and vivid account of the making of the postwar economic order. <i>The Battle of Bretton Woods</i> tells the fascinating story of the contest between the United States and Britain, led by the outsized personalities of Harry Dexter White and John Maynard Keynes, to reconcile their competing visions and interests."<b>--Liaquat Ahamed, author of <i>Lords of Finance</i></b></p><p>"A riveting, exceptionally well-written account of the birth of the postwar economic order, and the roles of two determined men who were competing to define it. <i>The Battle of Bretton Woods</i> is a must-read work of economic and diplomatic history with great relevance to today."<b>--Alan Greenspan, former chairman of the Federal Reserve</b></p><p>"This is a fascinating study of monetary affairs and the politics of international finance, all tied up in the history of the Bretton Woods system and its ultimate demise. The book is full of lessons that are relevant today in a world that still resists international monetary reform."<b>--Paul Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve</b></p><p>"Benn Steil has written a fascinating book with far-reaching consequences. In seeing the creation of the postwar economic system through the prism of the harsh interaction between Keynes and White, he makes complicated financial issues easy to fathom. Above all, Steil conclusively establishes the truth of an astonishing paradox--that White, the architect of the global capitalist financial architecture, was also a secret agent of the Soviet Union!"<b>--Andrew Roberts, author of <i>The Storm of War</i></b></p><p>"Beautifully and engagingly written, deeply researched, and of great contemporary interest, this book addresses how Bretton Woods really worked. One virtue of the book is that it places the United States and its chief negotiator, the enigmatic Harry Dexter White, at the center of the narrative. It also documents more fully and convincingly than any previous account the extent of White's espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union, a story that enhances an already gripping narrative."<b>--Harold James, author of <i>Making the European Monetary Union</i></b></p><b>Benn Steil</b> is senior fellow and director of international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations.

Architect, artist, furniture designer, and teacher, he has played a leading role in the development and practice of modern architecture and design, both nationally and internationally. Beginning in the late 1930s, at Cranbrook under Eliel Saarinen, Rapson became famous for his rapid, exquisite renderings and his creative reexamination of traditional furniture and housing forms. He also began a career-long involvement in architectural competitions and experimental programs that helped shape the future of modernism in America. In postwar Europe, his designs for nine U.S. embassy projects established a new international model for the American embassy abroad. <p>In 1954 Rapson assumed leadership of the University of Minnesota&#x2019;s School of Architecture, beginning a thirty-year tenure that would transform not only the school itself but the standing of the design profession within the state. </p><p>Over sixty years and against the tides and assaults of architectural fads and fashion, Ralph Rapson has maintained a consistency and commitment to the basic and best principles of modern architecture, unswervingly and without distraction. He has never lost sight of the larger questions of architecture&#x2014;its potential for community betterment and enrichment of the human experience.</p></p><p>"Ralph Rapson:Sixty Years of Modern Design joins a stable of award-winning books published by Afton Historical Society Press." -- St. Croix Valley Press<br> The Minneapolis Institute of Arts and The Frederick R.

Now who's going to tell you about the people preparing your meal? <br> <br>From 2015 James Beard Leadership Award winner Saru Jayaraman, <em>Forked</em> is an enlightening examination of what we don't talk about when we talk about restaurants: Is the line cook working through a case of stomach flu because he doesn't get paid sick days? Is the busser not being promoted because he speaks with an accent? Is the server tolerating sexual harassment because tips are her only income? <br><br>As most corporate restaurants continue to set low standards for worker wages and benefits, a new class of chefs and restaurateurs is working to foster sustainability in their food and their employees. <em>Forked</em> offers an insider's view of the highest--and lowest--scoring restaurants for worker pay and benefits in each sector of the restaurant industry, and with it, a new way of thinking about how and where we eat.<br></p><p><br><strong>Saru Jayaraman</strong> is Co-Founder and Co-Director of the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United (ROC United) and a graduate of Yale Law School and the Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. She has been named one of Crain's "40 Under 40," CNN's "Ten Visionary Women," New York magazine's "Influential of New York," and a 2014 White House "Champion of Change." Her work has been profiled extensively in the New York Times, and she has appeared on CNN, MSNBC, <em>Bill Moyers Journal</em>, <em>NBC Nightly News</em>, <em>Today</em>, and <em>Real Time with Bill Maher</em>.<br><br>"A revealing expos� of the realities of restaurant work that makes a strong case for reform." --<em>Kirkus Reviews</em> <br><p></p><br>"Well researched. Jayaraman investigates the employment practices of a wide range of restaurants, from fine dining establishments to fast-food chains; the issue that riles her most is the federal minimum wage for tipped workers." --<em>Wall Street Journal</em><p></p><br>"Paints a grim picture of the food business today: Millions of service industry employees live in poverty, most big restaurants are not great employers, and many still pay servers $2.13 an hour, the federal minimum for workers who receive tips. But the book also makes the case that restaurants can survive and even prosper while paying workers well and offering them generous benefits." --<em>New York Times</em><p></p><br>"Few people are better versed in the ways in which tipping marginalizes those who depend on it. Tipping, Jayaraman says, isn't merely problematic in its current, contemporary context; the practice is abhorrent from a historical perspective, too." --<em>Washington Post</em><p></p><br>"Offers case studies and rankings of the working conditions at eateries, ranging from greasy spoon diners to coffee shops, white tablecloth places to national chains. As Jayaraman argues, restaurants can be both profitable and good places to work, too." --<em>NPR's "The Salt"</em><p></p><br>"The purpose of the book is not to start a vicious boycott or pat the good guys on the back; it is to inform diners about their choices. Jayaraman believes that elevated standards will ultimately benefit restaurant owners by creating sustainable improvements in employee loyalty, customer service and profits. Her fundamental message is that when workers do better, employers do better too." --<em>Food and Wine</em><p></p><br>"Not everyone has the luxury of quitting their horrible, no good, underpaid food service job, and it's those workers who are the subject of <em>Forked</em>." --<em>The Grist</em><p></p><br>"<em>Forked</em> examines how restaurants treat everyone from bussers to line cooks. It promises to peek behind the scenes at restaurants to show how they pay and treat their employees. Will it change how we think of dining out? Author Saru Jayaraman hopes so." --<em>Eater</em><p></p><br>"Jayaraman's well-articulated and -researched argument for higher standards in the restaurant industry focuses on workers over profit and how this approach is more sustainable in the long term." --<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"No one has done more to move forward the rights of food and restaurant workers than Saru Jayaraman. This is the story of the next steps in the movement, as told by the woman who is creating them." --Mark Bittman, author of <em>The Kitchen Matrix</em> and <em>A Bone to Pick: The Good and Bad News About Food</em><p></p><br>"That restaurant workers can be paid as little as $2.13 an hour and require food assistance to survive is a national scandal. <em>Forked</em> tells the stories of enlightened restaurant owners who treat and pay workers decently, with immediate returns in employee loyalty, better customer service-and profits. This book should inspire all restaurant owners to take the "high road," and all of us restaurant customers to demand that they do." --Marion Nestle, Professor of Nutrition, Food Studies, and Public Health at New York University and author of <em>Soda Politics: Taking on Big Soda (and Winning)</em><p></p><br>"Saru Jayaraman makes a powerful case that an employee-first restaurant culture is not just the right thing to do, but also leads to more sustainable-and more profitable-business fortunes. It's especially gratifying to study her list of 'high road' employers, peppered with real life examples that will no doubt inspire and light the way for others." --Danny Meyer, CEO of Union Square Hospitality Group and author of <em>Setting the Table: The Transforming Power of Hospitality in Business</em><p></p><br>"A critical book that shines light on the restaurant industry and all the practices that undermine workers-especially women.

Committed to free speech, free love, and politically engaged art, they swept away sexual prudery, stodgy bourgeois art, and political conservatism as they clamorously declared the birth of the new.<br><br>Christine Stansell offers the first comprehensive history of this legary period. She takes us deep into the downtown bohemia, which brought together creative dissenters from all walks of life: hobos and Harvard men, society matrons and immigrant Jews, wobblies and New Women, poets and anarchists. And she depicts their lyrical hopes for the century they felt they were sponsoring-a radiant vision of modernity, both egalitarian and artful, that flourished briefly, poignantly, until America entered the First World War and patriotism trumped self-expression.<br></p><p>"On or about December 1910," Virginia Woolf once wrote, "human character changed." In the great capitals of Europe and America, the gray veil of Victorian values lifted; modernism, once the province of a few artistic experimenters, took the fore; subjects hitherto not considered to be fit for polite society, from women's rights to free love, became the subjects of parlor discussion.<p> New York's Greenwich Village, writes Princeton University historian Christine Stansell in this engaging study, became the epicenter of this great social earthquake. Fueled by wealthy patrons and fed by refugees from Europe and the Midwest, New York's once isolated bohemian community generated social trends that would be widely copied, and in the process "made Greenwich Village into a beacon of American possibility in the new age." Among their number were the anarchist politician Emma Goldman, the radical journalists John Reed and Louise Bryant, and the writers Eugene O'Neill and Kenneth Burke, all of whom insisted on making an art form of one's life--and on rattling a few cages while doing so. The individual actors in this social revolution, Stansell observes, may be little remembered today, but elements of their belief--openness in social relationships, equality among men and women, and "a skepticism at once relentlessly questioning of America and entirely embroiled in its future"--are our common coin today. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Christine Stansell, a professor of history at Princeton University, is the author of City of Women: Sex and Class in New York City, 1789-1860.

A sculptor, conceptual artist, and furniture maker, his clients have ranged from Lisa Eisner and Tommy Lee Jones to the Getty Museum's Los Angeles offices. This first monograph on the artist, published on the occasion of the first museum exhibition of his work, traces how his creations have evolved over the years, from the nonfunctional yet allusive sculptural works of the early 1980s, moving through the production furniture made for his Los Angeles-based company, Domestic Furniture Co., and culminating in the &#x201c;hillbilly modernist&#x201d; sensibility of his present pieces. It considers his approach to materials, which ranges from the art-like, constructivist plywood furniture of his &#x201c;classic&#x201d; domestic period to the exotic hardwoods he currently employs. An interesting hybrid of artist and designer, McMakin makes magic, and it's all there behind <i>A Door Meant as Adornment</i>.</p><p>Roy McMakin was born in 1956 in Lander, Wyoming. His work has been shown in solo exhibitions at galleries in San Diego, Los Angeles, and Seattle, and in group shows at such institutions as The Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art; the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum; and the Cincinnati Art Museum.

There are color photographs and drawings throughout, and also a list of water garden plants. Nash aims the book at amateur builders, but beware; many of these projects, especially the larger ponds, will not be easy. <i>George Cohen</i></p><h2>The Little Golden Calf</h2><p>One of the greatest Russian satires ever published and one of the last works of Russian fiction to poke fun at the Soviet regime before the imposition of unbridled state censorship in the 1930s. Anne O. Fisher&#39;s lively translation (the first since 1961) is copiously annotated, and includes an introduction by Alexandra Ilf, the daughter of one of the book&#39;s two co-authors. The Little Golden Calf is a true gem of Russian literature. This edition is the first unabridged, uncensored English translation, and is 100% true to the original serial publication. It resurrects the con man Ostap Bender, &#34;the smooth operator,&#34; and follows him and his three hapless co-conspirators on a hilarious romp through the Soviet Russia and Central Asia of 1930. Bender claims that he has &#34;very serious differences of opinion with Soviet power. It wants to build socialism, and I don&#39;t.&#34; He wants to emigrate to Rio de Janeiro, so he and his crew set off in pursuit of an underground millionaire, who, Bender is certain, &#34;will bring me his money himself, on a little saucer with a sky-blue rim.&#34; The Little Golden Calf stands alongside the works of Griboyedov, Pushkin, and Gogol for its profound effect on Russian language and culture. The tale overflows with trenchant catchphrases and legendary literary episodes, offering a portrait of Russian life that is as funny and true today as it was when the novel was first published. For decades, foreigners trying to understand Russia have been advised to read the adventures of Ostap (&#34;This book says more about Russia than a dozen tracts written by foreigners...&#34; the New York Times wrote in 1932).

Bounded by the first Washington Administration and the last Jackson Administration, this is the period in which democracy grew and shaped the nation. It witnessed the launching of the federal government; the expansion of the frontier; the establishment of a party system; the enunciation of a foreign policy; the manufacture of the symbols of nationalism; and the forging of the arguments of sectionalism.

In Pueblo Indian Painting, art historian J. J. Brody presents the first complete history of this vibrant art and places it squarely within the contexts of Pueblo culture and Euro-American modernism, bringing long-overdue recognition to the tradition and its preeminent practitioners as a vital part of American art history.</p><p>J. J. Brody is professor emeritus of art and art history at the University of New Mexico and former director of the Maxwell Museum of Anthropology. He is the author of Mimbres Painted Pottery and Anasazi and Pueblo Painting, published by the School of American Research and the University of New Mexico Press.A preeminent scholar of ancient and modern Southwestern Native American cultures, Brody centers his investigation of Pueblo painting around seven influential artists and the cross-cultural impact of key non-Indian patrons. Their collaborations make fascinating reading and illuminate the course of future developments in Native American easel painting. The lives of artists Velino Herrera, Alfonso Roybal and Tonita Pe?a, among others, provide vivid examples of the conflict between creative impulses and cultural taboos. Despite the encouragement of appreciative patrons, these artists faced great opposition and displeasure from their Pueblo communities. Equally important, Brody is not afraid to revisit a persistent issue: where does anthropology leave off and art history begin? The result is a masterly reevaluation of the history of early-modern Pueblo painting filled with rich insights. Highly recommended for academic collections.?Paula A.

She taught undergraduate courses in family involvement, as well as graduate courses in educational psychology and child development. She also worked as a home-school coordinator through Title 1 in the Missoula School District in Missoula, Montana. During her six years in this position, she oversaw the development of family resource centers at the elementary and middle school levels, worked with family outreach specialists and social workers, established parent libraries, and conducted home visits. As home-school coordinator, she helped develop an Even Start program serving children and parents. Having taught second, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth grades, as well as high school, she has worked collaboratively with families for more than 30 years. In 2014 in collaboration with two rural upstate New York school districts, she consulted on establishment of two elementary family resource centers. These two centers will be part of a larger SUNY clinical field experience effort to prepare teacher candidates to authentically work with families.</p>&#34;You can read any number of text books on schools and family involvement, but this textbook stands out in that the ideas presented are practical, the examples are real, and future teachers will be able to actually incorporate many of the suggestions into their own dealings with parents, families, and schools.&#34; -- Kathleen M.

Students are thus easily able to access any issue that would confront the real estate student or practitioner. <p> Although the initial focus is on a residential real estate transaction, <b>Understanding Modern Real Estate Transactions</b> also addresses issues applicable to commercial real estate transactions. This treatise also provides case analysis, focusing on the cases that appear in the most prominent and widely used texts for modern real estate. Numerous simple hypotheticals throughout the text explain the more complicated theories and rules. </p><p> The Third Edition includes expanded treatment of issues leading up to and arising from the real estate crisis, including the securitization of mortgages, the importance of the holder-in-due course, predatory lending, and foreclosures in a post-crash world. </p><p> Loaded with practical tips from a noted expert in real estate transactions, this treatise is beneficial for the neophyte and expert alike, providing insight on the issues likely to appear on exams from the professor's perspective.

The keepers of the Warsaw zoo, Jan and Antonina Zabinski, survive the bombardment of the city, only to see the occupiers ruthlessly kill many of their animals. The Nazis then carry off the prized specimens to Berlin for their program to create the &#x201c;purest&#x201d; breeds, much as they saw themselves as the purest human race. Opposed to all the Nazis represented, the Zabinskis risked their lives by hiding Jews in the now-empty animal cages, saving as many as three hundred people from extermination. Acclaimed, best-selling author Diane Ackerman, fascinated both by the Zabinskis&#x2019; courage and by Antonina&#x2019;s incredible sensitivity to all living beings, tells a moving and dramatic story of the power of empathy and the strength of love.</p><p>A Focus Features release, it is directed by Niki Caro, written by Angela Workman.</p> 8 pages of illustrations</p><p><b>Amazon Significant Seven, September 2007</b>: On the heels of Alan Weisman's <i>The World Without Us</i> I picked up Diane Ackerman's <i>The Zookeeper&#x2019;s Wife</i>. Both books take you to Poland's forest primeval, the Bialowieza, and paint a richly textured portrait of a natural world that few of us would recognize. The similarities end there, however, as Ackerman explores how that sense of natural order imploded under the Nazi occupation of Poland. Jan and Antonina Zabiniski--keepers of the Warsaw Zoo who sheltered Jews from the Warsaw ghetto--serve as Ackerman's lens to this moment in time, and she weaves their experiences and reflections so seamlessly into the story that it would be easy to read the book as Antonina's own miraculous memoir. Jan and Antonina's passion for life in all its diversity illustrates ever more powerfully just how narrow the Nazi worldview was, and what tragedy it wreaked. <i>The Zookeeper&#x2019;s Wife</i> is a powerful testament to their courage and--like Irene Nemirovsky's <i>Suite Francaise</i>--brings this period of European history into intimate view.<i> --Anne Bartholomew</i><br><br><strong>Diane Ackerman</strong> has been the finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Nonfiction in addition to many other awards and recognitions for her work, which include the best-selling <em>The Zookeeper's Wife</em> and <em>A Natural History of the Senses</em>.

A complex meditation on courtly and religious ideals, <em>Cleanness </em>has been praised for its densely figurative language, elaborate descriptive set pieces, and moving depictions of cosmic and human drama. More recently, the poem has also attracted attention for contributing to the history of sexuality in its comparatively frank discussion of sexual practices. </p> <p> Kevin Gustafson&#x2019;s new translation captures the original&#x2019;s poetic qualities while making the often difficult text accessible to modern readers. The facing-page format allows readers to experience the original alliterative Middle English and to compare the texts. Appendices include relevant verses from the Douay-Rheims Bible and excerpts from contemporary romances, chronicles, and theological writings. </p></p><p><p> <strong>Kevin Gustafson </strong>is Associate Professor of Medieval and Early Modern Studies at the University of Texas at Arlington. </p><p> &#x201c;In recent years, <em>Cleanness </em>has come into its own as one of the most significant English poems for the study of late medieval attitudes toward sexuality, sin, and pleasure. Kevin Gustafson&#x2019;s superb new edition and translation is the best text of <em>Cleanness </em>available for classroom use; not only medievalists, but students of spirituality and of the history of sexuality will all find it essential.&#x201d; &#x2015; Robert Sturges, Arizona State University </p> <p> &#x201c;Kevin Gustafson&#x2019;s new edition and translation ends the era of excuses for not teaching <em>Cleanness</em>. He provides a trustworthy Middle English text and crafts a careful, literal translation that captures the narrative energy, rich pathos, and pensive tone of the original without mimicry or self-conscious device. The critical introduction and primary documents allow the reader to study the poem in literary and theological context. We now can give our students a much fuller picture of medieval alliterative poetry and can confront together in the classroom the dynamic and challenging issues of religion, sex, race, and violence that <em>Cleanness</em> so relentlessly explores.&#x201d; &#x2015; Michael Calabrese, California State University, Los Angeles </p></p>
